 * Perform actual processing of the resource content from the {@link Reader} and writes the processed content to the
 * {@link Writer}. The processor should focus only on transformation. If a processing fails, it is preferred to
 * propagate the exception, because wro4j can allow custom behavior for this situation. It is possible to treat the
 * exceptions by leaving the processed output unchanged, but in this case you may not benefit of global configuration.

   * this way you can ignore the other preProcessors from the chain.<br/>
   * It is not require to explicitly handle exception. When the processing fails, the following can happen:
   * <ul>
   * <li>the exception is wrapped in {@link RuntimeException} and the processing chain is interrupted (by default)</li>
   * <li>content remains unchanged (if {@link WroConfiguration#isIgnoreFailingProcessor()} is true)</li>
   * </ul>

   * It is not required to close the reader and writers, because these will be closed for you.

   * @param reader
   *          {@link Reader} used to read processed resource content.
   * @param writer
   *          {@link Writer} where used to write processed results.
   * @throws IOException
   *           when an exception occurs. The future version will change the exception type to {@link Exception}, because
   *           any exception may occur during processing. The processing failure will be handled based on value of
   *           {@link WroConfiguration#isIgnoreFailingProcessor()} configuration flag.
