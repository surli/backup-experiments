# TODO
- testPage.css request is not consistent (investigate, probably a thread-safety issue). 
# Callbacks synchronization     
# YuiCssMin throws stackOverflow when processing a css with large dataUri encoded (ex: font module with no dataUri size limit). Probably an invalid regexp.

# DONE
- ensure InjectorBuilder doesn't perform redundant initialization.
- wroModel reload seems to be broken
- DispatchertreamLocator should handle 404 dispatch and try http call to locate the resource
