/**
 * A thread-safe sorted list of items and related quantities, which is bounded by a configurable maximum capacity.
 * Intended for frequent writes and occasional reads.
 * <p/>
 * The list is at all times sorted by the provided quantity comparator (natural ordering by default). Adding an element
 * that would be added after the last element of the list has no effect if the list if already full. Adding an element
 * to any position in the list means that the last element will be discarded. Adding an element that already exists in
 * the list is equivalent to removing the element and adding it again.
 * <p/>
 * Note that the list can be configured with a capacity and maxCapacity. An example will be used to illustrate the difference.
 * Let's say we want to keep track of 3 most popular items, where popularity is an integer number of likes. In that case
 * we would construct a list of capacity 3. However, if that really was the capacity of the list, then after adding items
 * with 100, 90, and 80 likes respectively would mean that an item with 79 likes will be ignored. Then, if the last item
 * in the list is "unliked" by 10 people, we end up with a list of 100, 90, and 70. This is not the truth, since there is
 * an item with 79 likes, which we've ignored. To account for these scenarios, it is possible to provide a maxCapacity, which
 * adds some extra space to the list. In the example above, a capacity of 3 and maxCapacity of 4 would prevent the anomaly,
 * since we would remember (but not show) the item with 79 likes.
 *
 * @param <T> type of the stored items.
 * @param <C> type of the quantities associated with the items.
