= Dozer

== What is Dozer?
Dozer is a Java Bean to Java Bean mapper that recursively copies data from one object to another.
Typically, these Java Beans will be of different complex types.

Dozer supports simple property mapping, complex type mapping, bi-directional mapping,
implicit-explicit mapping, as well as recursive mapping.
This includes mapping collection attributes that also need mmapping at the element level.

Please read the link:about/about.adoc[about] page for detailed information on Dozer.
