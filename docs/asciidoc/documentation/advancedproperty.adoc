== Mapping Concepts
=== Assembler Pattern

. Martin Fowler has a great explanation of why and when you would use an

. Basically, it is a way to take multiple fine grain objects and create
one coarse grain object used for data transfer. As long as you have
mappings defined for each of your fine grained objects to your coarse
grain object you can call the mapper multiple times to achieve the
desired assembler pattern.

mapper.map(sourceA, ClassB.class);

Let's say that ClassA, ClassB, and ClassC all map to ClassD. First
create these individual mappings in the mapping file. Next, call the
mapper once for each mapping. Note that this would also work in a
bi-directinonal manner.

ClassD d = new ClassD();
mapper.map(sourceA, d);
mapper.map(sourceB, d);
mapper.map(sourceC, d);
