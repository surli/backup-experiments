The problem #5 (rewrite_relative_links) is particularly tricky, so this test file
allows you to test it.  Run 
`cp src/test/resources/test-fix-md.txt.stat src/test/resources/test-fix-md.txt`
then
`awk -f bin/fix-md-dialect.awk src/test/resources/test-fix-md.txt`
The .txt file will be re-written in place.  You can check the results by comparing
the "Should be..." lines with the lines above them.  Contrast with the original
.stat file to see before re-write.

Here [Don't rewrite abs urls](http://nowhere.foo:80/README.md) is case 1.
Should still be               http://nowhere.foo:80/README.md

Here [Fleeber](index.html) is case 2a.
Should be      index.html

Here [Fleeber](NO_README.html) is case 2b.
Should be      NO_README.html

Here [Fleeber](index.html#Fleeber) is case 2c.
Should be      index.html#Fleeber

Here [Fleeber](NO_README.html#Fleeber) is case 2b.
Should be      NO_README.html#Fleeber

Here [`Fleeber`](multi.html#Fleeber) is case 3.
Should be        multi.html#Fleeber

Here [When All Is Lost](#When_All_Is_Lost) intra-document link is case 4.
Should be               #When_All_Is_Lost

Here is a combo: [Creative Nonsense](../metron-params/index.html#Creative_Nonsense) and [`RPM`](../metron-params/index.html#RPM)
Should be:                           ../metron-params/index.html#Creative_Nonsense) and [`RPM`](../metron-params/index.html#RPM)
