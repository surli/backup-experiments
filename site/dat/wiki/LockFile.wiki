LockFile plugin allows you to specify a lock file wich will be created in the beginning of the test and deleted after test. 
You can also specify a filename with wildcards to check for existing lock files. This helps preventing several JMeter instances running at the same machine.

Test will not be started if existing lock files found.

To use, add Config -> *jp@gc - Lock File Config*, then specify a lock file and a pattern.
