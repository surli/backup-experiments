OAuth is an authentication protocol which provides the possibility to users to hand out tokens instead of credentials to their data hosted by a given service provider. The token grants  access for specific resources for a defined period of time.

OAuth sampler is an extended REST sampler which in addition includes the properties needed for this authorization:

  * Consumer Key
  * Consumer Secret
  * These two properties together authenticate the Consumer to the Service Provider.
