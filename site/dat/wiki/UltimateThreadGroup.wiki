"Ultimate" means there will be no need in further Thread Group plugins. The features that everyone needed in JMeter and they finally available:
  * infinite number of schedule records
  * separate ramp-up time, shutdown time, flight time for each shedule record
  * and, of course, trustworthy load preview graph

= Example =
Let's configure Ultimate Thread Group as following:

And then try to run test. Look how predictable our [ActiveThreadsOverTime active threads] graph is:

== Special Property Processing ==

There is a way to configure thread group from special jmeter property _threads_schedule_.
Property can be specified either in user.properties file (jmeter.properties also applicable), or
from command line like _-J "threads_schedule=..."_. 

Schedule is specified with a list of _spawn_ directives:
  * _spawn(threadsCount, initalDelay, startupTime, holdLoadFor, shutdownTime)_ - spawns specified threads number and configures start time, ramp-up time, flight time and shutdown time
  
Duration values (initialDelay, startupTime, holdLoadFor, shutdownTime) may be specified with shorthand, case-insensitive modifiers:
  * s - seconds
  * m - minutes
  * h - hours
  * d - days

Duration setting may be combined like _1d11h23m6s_.

Example of load profile string: {{{threads_schedule=spawn(15,1s,1s,1s,1s) spawn(40,1s,3s,1s,2s)}}}
