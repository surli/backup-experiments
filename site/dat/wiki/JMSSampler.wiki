== Description ==

If you are using JMS (Java Message Service) to send and receive messages between two or more clients, we have created a sampler which enables you to send and receive messages. It is incorporated into the Java request sampler, to use this sampler choose from the classname dropdown list: {{{com.atlantbh.jmeter.plugins.jmstools.JMSUtil}}}.

To send or receive a message the following needs to specified:
  * connection URL
  * binding url
  * direction
  * message (if we are sending a message)

Connection and Binding URL correspond to Apache QPID server and queue respectively used for either sending or receiving a message. In the message fileld, we define a message we would like to send.

A definition of whether we are a sender or a receipient is defined in direction using either SEND or RECEIVE.

In the header properties, we can add additional; separated properties that we would like to add to our message that we send. Header properties reference on the other hand is the a property where a received message is stored.

Message selector is used as a filter for received messages (ex: variable=’value’). In the QPID case, it is used as a filter on the receipient queue.

Receive timeout is the amount of time a receiver waits for a message to be received. In the case of QPID, it means a time for a message to arrive to a  specific queue. Tomeout is defined in ms. If not  provided, default value is 3000ms or 30 sec.
