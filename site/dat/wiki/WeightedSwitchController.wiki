This plugin was inspired by _[http://www.dynatrace.com/?utm_source=jmplinnerpages&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=jmpininnerpgs&utm_campaign=JMeter%2BPlug%2BIn%2BWiki Dynatrace LLC]_, implemented by _[http://blazemeter.com/?utm_source=jmplinnerpages&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=jmpininnerpgs&utm_campaign=JMeter%2BPlug%2BIn%2BWiki BlazeMeter Inc.]_, and then contributed to community as Open Source.

== Description ==

This controller takes the information about child elements and offers managing relative weights for them. Relative weight means how frequently the child element will be executed during thread iterations. Please note that each thread has independent counter of iterations.
