  * Retrieve job counter by providing a job id and group name
  * Retrieve the job statistics by providing a job id: job statistics are returned e.g. progress of the job, url
  * Retrieve counters on job task level by providing a job id: for each task counters for the job are returned, same as option 1 but provides the counters for all tasks
  * Retrieve job task level statistics by providing a job id: for each task statistics are retuned, same as option 3 but on task level.
