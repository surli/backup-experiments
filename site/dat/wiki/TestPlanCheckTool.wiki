Sometimes you need an automated way to check JMX file consistency without running the test. For example, if you plan to spin up tens of AWS machines to generate the load, you don't want all them to fail because of missing JAR for third-party plugin. To avoid that, use JMX Checker Tool to verify that JMX is loadable. Additionally, the tool can dump the test tree or print simple elements count.

== Usage and Parameters ==

Just checking JMX consistency:

{{{
jmeter/lib/ext/TestPlanCheck.sh --jmx MyTestPlan.jmx
}}}

As a result, the exit code for the tool will be zero in case of successfully loaded JMX and non-zero in case of any error.

Dumping tree structure and printing stats:

{{{
jmeter/lib/ext/TestPlanCheck.sh --jmx MyTestPlan.jmx --stats --tree-dump
}}}

The sample output from the tool will look like this:
