This !PreProcessor allows more flexible file reading than
[http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/usermanual/component_reference.html#CSV_Data_Set_Config CSV Data Set Config]:
  * length-prefixed format allows storing and reading binary data, this is useful when you use TCP or Raw samplers
  * it is [http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/usermanual/test_plan.html#preprocessors PreProcessor], so it may be placed in different scopes and affect selected samplers
  * it is shared between all threads, so file may be read consecutively by parallel threads

The plugin makes [HTTP Raw Request and UDP Request usage easier and allows
load testing with huge datasets at high request rate.

== Raw File Format ==

File reader use length-prefixed binary file format. It reads data until newline
and tries to interpret it as next chunk length. Then it reads file for calculated length
and assigns data to variable. Then repeats.

Chunk example:

{{{
675
GET /img/spaw2/js/spaw.js.php HTTP/1.1
Host: apc.kg
Connection: keep-alive
Referer: http://apc.kg/blog/247/comment/
Accept: */*
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US)
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: ru-RU,ru;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.6,en;q=0.4
Accept-Charset: windows-1251,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3
Cookie: __utmz=50250230.1297072279.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)|utmccn=(direct)|utmcmd=(none);
}}}

Make note that you may have several extra newlines after chunk data before next chunk size.
Also you may have any data after chunk size before newline (separated from size with space),
it will be used in future versions as chunk marker.
