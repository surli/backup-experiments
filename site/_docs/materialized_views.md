There are several different ways to exploit materialized views in Calcite.

{:toc}

## Materialized views maintained by Calcite

For details, see the [lattices documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/lattice.html).

## Expose materialized views from adapters

Some adapters and projects that rely on Calcite have their own notion of materialized views.
For example, Apache Cassandra allows the user to define materialized views based on existing tables which are automatically maintained.
The Cassandra adapter automatically exposes these materialized views to Calcite.
Another example is Apache Hive, whose integration with Calcite materialized views is ongoing.
By understanding some tables as materialized views, Calcite has the opportunity to automatically rewrite queries to use these views.

## View-based query rewriting

View-based query rewriting aims to take an input query which can be answered using a preexisting view and rewrite the query to make use of the view.
Calcite employs two forms of view-based query rewriting.
The first is based on view substitution before the planning phase based on an extension of a {SubstitutionVisitor}.
{MaterializedViewSubstitutionVisitor} aims to substitute part of the relational algebra tree with an equivalent expression which makes use of a materialized view.

The following example is taken from the documentation of {SubstitutionVisitor}:

 * Query: `SELECT a, c FROM t WHERE x = 5 AND b = 4`
 * Target (materialized view definition): `SELECT a, b, c FROM t WHERE x = 5`
 * Replacement: `SELECT * FROM mv`
 * Result: `SELECT a, c FROM mv WHERE b = 4`

Note that {result} uses the materialized view table {mv} and a simplified condition {b = 4}.
This can accomplish a large number of rewritings.
However, this approach is not scalable in the presence of complex views, e.g., views containing many join operators,
since it relies on the planner rules to create the equivalence between expressions.

In turn, two alternative rules that attempt to match queries to views defined using arbitrary queries,
have been proposed. They are both based on the ideas of the [same paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.95.113).

__MaterializedViewJoinRule__ is the first alternative. There are several limitations to the current implementation:

1. The query defining the view must use only inner joins
2. Only equality predicates are supported
3. Predicates on tables used in the view must exactly match predicates in the query
4. Rewriting is unoptimized and will attempt to match all views against each query

These limitations are not fundamental the approach however and will hopefully be removed in the future.
Note that the rule is currently disabled by default.
To make use of the rule, {MaterializedViewJoinRule.INSTANCE_PROJECT} and {MaterializedViewJoinRule.INSTANCE_TABLE_SCAN} need to be added to the planner.

__AbstractMaterializedViewRule__ is the second alternative. It builds on the same ideas but it attempts to be more generic.
In particular, some of the limitations of the previous rule, such as number `2.` and `3.`, do not exist for this rule.
Additionally, the rule will be able to rewrite expressions rooted at an Aggregate operator, rolling aggregations up if necessary.

However, this rule still presents some limitations too. In addition to `1.` and `4.` above, the rule presents following
shortcomings that we plan to address with follow-up extensions:

* It does not produce rewritings using Union operators, e.g., a given query could be partially answered from the
{mv} (year = 2014) and from the query (not(year=2014)). This can be useful if {mv} is stored in a system such as
Druid.
* Currently query and {mv} must use the same tables.

This rule is currently enabled by default.
