<p>
The <code>jpa</code> plugin provides minimal support for discovering JPA
annotations like <code>Column</code>.  Note that this module is not widely
used and the core team recommends using native <code>jdbi</code> constructs
instead.

This package exists mostly to help you convince your boss to let you try out Jdbi:

<blockquote>
You: See, they even have JPA integration! kinda <br>
Boss: What was that last part? <br>
You: Nothing.
</blockquote>
