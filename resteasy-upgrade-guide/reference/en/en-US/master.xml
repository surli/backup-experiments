   A number of API classes in Resteasy 2, which is based on the JAX-RS 1.1 specification 
   (<ulink url="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311">https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311</ulink>),
   have been deprecated in, and will eventually be removed from, Resteasy 3, which is based on JAX-RS 2.0
   (<ulink url="https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr339/index.html">https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr339/index.html</ulink>).
   For the most part, these changes are due to the fact that a number
   of facilities specific to Resteasy were introduced in Resteasy 2 and then formalized, in somewhat different
   form, in JAX-RS 2.0. A few other facilities in Resteasy simply were not carried over to Resteasy 3.

   This short document describes the principal changes from Resteasy 2 to Resteasy 3 and gives some
   hints about upgrading code from the Resteasy 2 API to Resteasy 3. Additional information can be found in the 
   Resteasy Users Guides (<ulink url="http://resteasy.jboss.org/docs.html">http://resteasy.jboss.org/docs.html</ulink>).
   A more extensive treatment may be found in the O'Reilly book <emphasis>RESTful Java with JAX-RS 2.0, 2nd Edition</emphasis>,
   by Bill Burke.
