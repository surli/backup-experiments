/**
 * An Apex plugin is a user code which runs inside Stram. The interaction
 * between plugin and Stram is managed by DAGExecutionPluginContext. Plugin can register to handle event in interest
 * with callback handler using ${@link DAGExecutionPluginContext#register(DAGExecutionPluginContext.RegistrationType, DAGExecutionPluginContext.Handler)}
 *
 * Following events are supported
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@see DAGExecutionPluginContext.HEARTBEAT} The heartbeat from a container is delivered to the plugin after it has been handled by stram</li>
 *   <li>{@see DAGExecutionPluginContext.STRAM_EVENT} All the Stram event generated in Stram will be delivered to the plugin</li>
 *   <li>{@see DAGExecutionPluginContext.COMMIT_EVENT} When committedWindowId changes in the platform an event will be delivered to the plugin</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * A plugin should register a single handler for an event, In case multiple handlers are registered for an event,
 * then the last registered handler will be used. Plugin should cleanup additional resources created by it during shutdown
 * such as helper threads and open files.
