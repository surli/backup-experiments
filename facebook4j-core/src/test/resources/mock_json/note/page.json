While the news feed can become very busy, there has to be a way to allow the customers (the fans and the business) to reach each other without an arbitrary mathmatical equation.   My thoughts are that Facebook will likely become much less relevant to many businesses that don't have a large budget for this.  When relevancy drops...memes become the norm.  Oh No!!

To expand its customer base, the company now uses Friends of Connections Targeting to target friends of people who have liked its Facebook page <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/LuxuryLink\">Luxury Link<\/a>.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Alia Henson, Luxury Link\u2019s Social Media Manager, says the company\u2019s overall objective has been to drive engagement and increase brand visibility for the well-traveled luxury customer. To begin her campaign, Alia created a page to generate more awareness.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Once people connect to the page, they can get information about new featured destinations and getaways. She has continued to enhance the page by adding tabs where people can sign up for the Luxury Link newsletter as well as search for hotels.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>To fuel engagement, Alia regularly posts questions as status updates on the page. Recently, Luxury Link hosted an hour-long live chat about Fiji during which customers were able to interact with the brand. \u201cDid you enjoy the Live Chat on Fiji yesterday?\u201d a follow-up posts asks. \u201cWe want to know what destinations are of interest to you!\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In addition to sprucing up the company\u2019s page, Alia has also introduced the Like button on LuxuryLink.com for nearly every product description page showcasing hotels and resorts. This gives customers another way to connect to the Luxury Link page and receive updates in their News Feed.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>With the Like implementation on its website and by running continuous Facebook Ads, the company has grown its fans by 85 percent. Alia now runs Facebook Ads for her page in addition to running them to her website.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>She began by running a campaign featuring a contest\u2014the user simply had to like the page and they would have the option to enter themselves to win a trip to Italy, Greece or Guatemala. She used strong calls to action\u2014\u201cShake off winter with a spring getaway\u201d and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=14645\">Likes and Interests<\/a> targeting for people she thought would be interested in her offerings. For example, some of these words included \u201cChanel\u201d, \u201cFendi official page\u201d, \u201cPrada\u201d or \u201cStarbucks\u201d. She also decided to target users who are married, as she thought these people would be more interested in getaways.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Most recently, Alia has taken advantage of a new type of product on Facebook called <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ads/stories/\">Sponsored Stories<\/a>, which increase the visibility of people\u2019s authentic interactions with brands on Facebook by surfacing them on the right-hand column of Facebook. Sponsored Stories allow her to reach friends of people who are already connected to her page by tapping the power of word-of-mouth referrals.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>\u201cLeveraging Sponsored Stories has enabled us to grow our base of like-minded consumers, and increase sales,\u201d says Alia. \u201cWe have leveraged several tools such as IngBoo, which helps increase our visibility in the News Feed, so we can maintain a constant presence in our community.\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Alia says her activities on Facebook have been paying off. Traffic to the site from Facebook has increased 100 percent and revenue has also increased as a result. As of mid-August 2011, the company\u2019s page had reached nearly 28,000 fans. Engagement with those fans on Luxury Link\u2019s page has increased 200 percent.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Ever since running ads on Facebook, Alia has been following the comments from new fans who discuss different travel destinations on the page. One woman asked \u201cDo you have anything in NYC\u2026?\u201d and another user responded with a link to Luxury Link\u2019s New York City listings. In effect, the Page has become a central place where people are able to share information and learn from each other.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Alia plans to continue advertising with Facebook, as she is launching the second phase of Luxury Link&#039;s marketing campaign. She plans on using \u201cpage post like\u201d and \u201cdomain like\u201d Sponsored Stories to increase visibility to destinations, properties, and Luxury Link as a whole.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>She also plans to continue to grow engagement by using Facebook Ads to increase attendance to Luxury Link events such as its Live Travel Discussions with industry experts on its Facebook Page. \u201cOur goal is to continue to grow revenue by offering relevant content to our community and continuing to be the leader in social media marketing for the luxury travel industry,\u201d she says.<\/p><br /><\/div>",

With <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/advertising/\">Facebook Ads<\/a>, the business is able to reach its most likely potential customers by targeting people who have listed photography-related terms such as \u201ccameras,\u201d \u201cCanon,\u201d \u201cNikon,\u201d \u201cphotographer\u201d and \u201cphotography\u201d as <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=14645\">Likes and Interests<\/a> in their Facebook profiles.<\/p><p><span class=\"photo \"><img class=\"photo_img img\" src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/264384_10150312525646337_678361_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><\/span><\/p><p>The company, which sells all-in-one zoom lenses, telephoto zoom lenses, high-speed zoom lenses and others, first started using <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/advertising/\">Facebook Ads<\/a> in 2009 to raise awareness of the company.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>\u201cI feel we are getting great targeted exposure for minimal investment that can be adjusted on the fly so easily,\u201d says Stacie Errera, Chief Marketing Officer of Tamron USA. \u201cThere&#039;s no other platform we use to promote our brand and products that&#039;s easier than Facebook.\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Stacie says her main marketing objective on Facebook has been to let people who have an interest in photography learn about the various promotions that the company offers throughout the year, including seminar events, photo contests and rebates on Tamron products.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>At first, Stacie started advertising her product by linking her ad to relevant Tamron pages on the Web, where customers would be able to get information about a specific promotion. While this approach allowed people to get information right away, Stacie decided to try linking her ads to the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TamronLensesUSA\"> Tamron Lenses Facebook Page<\/a>.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>She reckoned it would be a way for fans to access all the relevant promotions through one advertising outlet. At the same time, it would help her keep new fans and once they were connected and engaged with the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TamronLensesUSA\">Page<\/a>. Why? Any time Tamron published to the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TamronLensesUSA\">Page<\/a>, they would receive updates in their News Feeds.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In June 2011, Stacie noticed that Tamron Lenses was only 1,300 fans away from the 10,000 mark. She thought that a campaign focused on advertising the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TamronLensesUSA\">Page<\/a> would be a great way to reach that goal.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>To generate engagement, Stacie started posting status updates on promotions and tips on how to take better photos, as she believed this was a key advantage offered to Facebook fans. People would be able to receive these updates as well as exclusive and timely articles.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>For example, one of her recent statuses in June offered a $50 mail-in rebate on Tamron&#039;s 18-270 VC PZD all-in-one zoom available for Canon, Nikon and Sony DSLRs with smaller sensors. \u201cJust in time for Father&#039;s Day!\u201d the status read. \u201cVisit your local Tamron retailer for details or our website at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tamron-usa.com&amp;h=3AQHV61SK&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" onmouseover=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.tamron-usa.com\\/&quot;);\" onclick=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/l.php?u=http\\u00253A\\u00252F\\u00252Fwww.tamron-usa.com&amp;h=3AQHV61SK&amp;s=1&quot;);\" target=\"_blank\">www.tamron-usa.com<\/a>\u201d. This update allowed Facebook fans to take advantage of this offer as soon as it was posted.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>When Stacie created her ads, she used both strong calls to action--\u2018Interact with your fellow Tamron fans!\u2019--and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=14645\">Likes and Interests<\/a> that were relevant to people who would be interested in Tamron Lenses. For example, her ads were targeted to people 24 and older whose <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=14645\">Likes and Interests<\/a> that were associated with \u201ccameras\u201d, \u201cCanon\u201d, \u201cNikon\u201d, \u201cphotographer\u201d or \u201cphotography\u201d.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Stacie says she was impressed with Facebook\u2019s advertising system because she says her campaign reached over 1 million users, and the CPM (cost per impression) value was effective. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent branding opportunity for us since we were targeting people with an interest in photography, rather than too broad of a target,\u201d Stacie says.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As of early July 2011, the company had surpassed its short-term goal of 10,000 fans.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Ever since running ads on Facebook, Stacie has been reading the comments from new fans who share how much they like their Tamron lenses on the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TamronLensesUSA\">Page<\/a>. One husband of a fan who answered Tamron\u2019s call for Father\u2019s Day photos and tips posted a comment on the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TamronLensesUSA\">Tamron Lenses Page<\/a>, saying how much he admired his wife\u2019s talent and told everyone how Tamron made her day.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Stacie says she is thrilled by the amount of communication that is happening among members of the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TamronLensesUSA\">Page<\/a>, as there are fans who enjoy critiquing Tamron\u2019s posts and engage with other fans to discuss their own critique. \u201cI believe these new fans arrived at our <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TamronLensesUSA\">Page<\/a> as a direct result of our latest campaign,\u201d she says.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Stacie plans to continue advertising with Facebook, as it was a top referring site for May and June, to continue facilitating a strong community where people can share their experiences. \u201cHaving the ability of targeting within the Facebook community is really terrific, says Stacie. \u201cI love that we can seek out potential fans by getting specific with demographic selections and key words.\u201d<\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><\/div>",

The way he sees things, the more than 750 friends that Frédéric and his wife Estelle have on Facebook together have more than 80,000 friends. That, he reckons, gives his family a huge network of friends of friends around the globe whose doors they can potentially knock on.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>\u201cWhen people travel overseas, it is often about going somewhere totally new where you don\u2019t know anyone,\u201d says Frédéric, 43. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a completely different approach. Our challenge is: Can we go around the world leveraging Facebook to stay with Facebook friends and friends of friends?\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>\u201cAround the World with 80,000\u201d friends, as he\u2019s dubbed the unique voyage detailed in this <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dv0e6xL3G1SI&amp;h=wAQHgV6DC&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" onmouseover=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=v0e6xL3G1SI&quot;);\" onclick=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/l.php?u=http\\u00253A\\u00252F\\u00252Fwww.youtube.com\\u00252Fwatch\\u00253Fv\\u00253Dv0e6xL3G1SI&amp;h=wAQHgV6DC&amp;s=1&quot;);\" target=\"_blank\">video<\/a>, is meant to be the social media era\u2019s twist on <em>Around the World in Eighty Days<\/em>. In the 1873 Jules Verne novel, English nobleman Phileas Fogg attempts to win a wager with members of his gentlemen\u2019s club by circling the globe in 80 days.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Colas are making a different bet of sorts, theirs being that Facebook friends will actually do things that real friends do, such as letting your entire family crash at their house. \u201cIf we only go to places where we have Facebook friends or friends of friends, will we find someone to let us stay in Patagonia?\u201d he asks. \u201cWill we find someone in Salt Lake City?\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The yearlong voyage is really more of a business trip than an extended vacation. Frédéric, Estelle, and their eight-year-old daughter Héloïse are using the journey as a way to raise enough money to fund the building of a school in Burkina Faso, aimed specifically at helping girls in a country where the female literacy rate is just 15 percent.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>For every night they\u2019re hosted by somebody, the Colas will donate $50 that would have gone toward a hotel room to the school. What\u2019s more, each time someone likes their <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/weliketheworld\">We Like The World<\/a> Facebook Page that they created to raise awareness for the cause, they\u2019ll donate another $1. All told, the Colas plan to contribute some $57,000 (\u20ac40,000) of their own money to the $143,000 (\u20ac100,000) project. For the remainder, they\u2019re looking for people to donate to the cause using their We Like The World <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/weliketheworld?sk=app_208195102528120\">donation application<\/a>.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>\u201cAt the end of the day, this will help more girls get an education,\u201d says Frédéric. \u201cMany major non-governmental organizations have shown that of all the causes for developing countries, the ones that have the best return on investment involve educating girls. The children of women who have five years of primary education are 40 percent less likely to die before the age of five\u201d Frédéric says.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As the co-founder of Fullsix, a leading digital market group in Europe with 1,000 employees worldwide, Frédéric says he\u2019s long appreciated the power of Facebook to inspire people to take action. \u201cIt can allow you to achieve things that you couldn\u2019t even imagine were possible if you were just by yourself,\u201d he says.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Through the app on the We Like The World Page, donations to fund the school\u2019s construction will go through the French charity The Child\u2019s Voice, which is partnering with the Colas on the project. To make sure people feel connected to the cause, donors will be able to contribute money towards a physical piece of the school\u2014a door, a window, a desk\u2014rather than giving an open-ended donation.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Along the way, the Colas plan to post regularly to the We Like The World Page about their hosts, the people they meet, and their various adventures. Among the countries they\u2019ll visit include Canada, the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, Tahiti, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, India and Turkey. \u201cWe think people will be interested in the story of how many fans we\u2019re adding or how many nights we\u2019re hosted,\u201d says Frédéric.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The We Like The World Page will also link to an exclusive <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/weliketheworld?sk=app_170822042971120\">Social Travel Map<\/a>. \u201cIt allows you to view our itinerary and current location in real time and, when connecting to Facebook, locate your own friends, and compare their locations with our itinerary,\u201d says Frédéric. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for fans of our Page to reach out to their friends who live in places we\u2019ll be visiting and say \u2018hey, can you help these guys out?\u2019\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Colas are departing on July 3, 2011 from Paris. While Estelle, an executive with BETC Euro RSCG, will be helping Héloïse with her schoolwork, Frédéric, who created Procter &amp; Gamble\u2019s Digital Marketing Department in Cincinnati in 1996, will have his own work to do.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As they travel, Frédéric plans to interview top marketing leaders from around the world about how they\u2019re embracing the digital age. His interviews will be published every two weeks in <em>Advertising Age<\/em> and other marketing magazines worldwide, and will also be available on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cmoworldtour.com&amp;h=UAQH3lvfr&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" onmouseover=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.cmoworldtour.com\\/&quot;);\" onclick=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/l.php?u=http\\u00253A\\u00252F\\u00252Fwww.cmoworldtour.com&amp;h=UAQH3lvfr&amp;s=1&quot;);\" target=\"_blank\">www.cmoworldtour.com<\/a>. \u201cIt will be the key people in marketing, and how they live in the digital age, from a personal and business standpoint,\u201d says Frédéric. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been done before.&quot;<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The Colas plan to return to London a year later in June 2012 before setting off to Burkina Faso. They\u2019re of course hoping the power of word of mouth on Facebook will help them build the school through donations. But they\u2019re also hoping it will build an appreciation of the ability of social media to change the world.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>&quot;We hope people will follow the story of our family going around the world and the story of the school being built,\u201d says Frédéric. \u201cWe also want people to understand that the power of the network on Facebook allows you to have an impact on real life so that they can be inspired as well.&quot;<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In the end, they want We Like The World to become a movement that will help other projects like their world tour leverage social media to grow and strive. \u201cIt is about making \u2018social\u2019 social,&quot; Frédéric, &quot;or leveraging social networks to boost social progress.&quot;<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In the Jules Verne book, Phileas Fogg wins his wager, succeeding in circumnavigating the globe by steamer and rail in 80 days. The Colas are similarly confident that betting on the support of 80,000 Facebook friends will get their school in Africa built.<\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><p><\/p><\/div>",

So in January 2010, she started to advertise with <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/FacebookAds\">Facebook Ads<\/a> to drive awareness of her company.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>When she started marketing on Facebook, Amy\u2019s primary objective was to drive traffic to the company\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.littlepassports.com%2F&amp;h=bAQEQQaIG&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" onmouseover=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.littlepassports.com\\/&quot;);\" onclick=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/l.php?u=http\\u00253A\\u00252F\\u00252Fwww.littlepassports.com\\u00252F&amp;h=bAQEQQaIG&amp;s=1&quot;);\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> and then convert the traffic into purchases. At the same time, she decided to create a <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php Facebook Page\">Facebook Page<\/a> for <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/littlepassports\">Little Passports<\/a> because she wanted to help build a community that would reinforce her brand and the value of her product.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Soon after creating the Page, Amy noticed people were interacting heavily with it. Parents were purchasing <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/littlepassports\">Little Passports<\/a> products and their kids were quickly getting attached to Sam and Sofia, the two characters with whom kids can \u201ctravel\u201d abroad. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/littlepassports\">Little Passports<\/a> even started to receive letters from kids addressed to Sam and Sofia.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>To engage with the fans, Amy started posting fun and creative status updates to the Page\u2019s Wall. One status revealed that Sam and Sofia love sharing recipes and that one of their favorites is the Mexican mole recipe they call \u201cChocolate Chicken.\u201d \u201cDo you have any recipes you\u2019d like to share with your Little Passports community?\u201d the post asked. \u201cWe\u2019d love to hear them!\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>When Amy created her ads, she used both strong calls to action\u2014\u2018Come meet Sam &amp; Sofia - sign up today!\u2019\u2014and discounts. For example, for anyone who was connected to her Page, she offered 10 percent off and included the discount code \u2018FBFRIEND\u2019.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/help/new/?page=863\">Facebook Targeting<\/a>, she was also able to reach a specific set of people most likely to be customers. She noticed that 90 percent of the Page\u2019s fans were females between the ages of 25 and 55. So ads were targeted to females in this age range and to people whose <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=14645Likes+and+Interests\">Likes and Interests<\/a> were associated with the following words: \u201cbeing mom\u201d, \u201cI love my kids\u201d, \u201ckids activities\u201d, or \u201cparenting\u201d.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Amy says she soon found that Facebook\u2019s targeted advertising was extremely effective. The demand for her product increased, she says, and sales picked up. She says her average CPC (cost per click) was below her internal targets.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Ever since running ads on Facebook, Amy has had greater insight into the experiences customers have had with her company. One mom shared on the Page that she was so inspired by <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/littlepassports\">Little Passports<\/a> that her family decided to host a Chinese exchange student. Another mom posted that she uses the Little Passports map so that her daughter can track where her relatives are posted in the military around the world.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As of May 2011, Amy plans to keep advertising with Facebook to continue to drive greater awareness to her company. \u201cFacebook is the only online advertising platform we are currently using,\u201d Amy says. \u201cIt is more targeted, relies more on word-of-mouth to generate sales, and, of course, meets our CPC objectives.\u201d<\/p><br /><\/div>",

But with an increasing number of relaxation beverages on the market, Springs, Texas-based Funktional Beverages knew it couldn\u2019t be too relaxed about its marketing plan. So in March 2010, the company turned to Facebook Ads to help raise awareness of its new drink. <\/p><p> <\/p><p><span class=\"photo photo_left\"><img class=\"photo_img img\" src=\"https://fbcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn2/208348_10150226986586337_7109511_a.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><\/span><\/p><p> <\/p><p>Chief Marketing Officer Tim Lucas started advertising on Facebook to create a forum where customers could establish an emotional connection with Purple Stuff. He did this by first creating a Facebook Page called <\/p><p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mypurplestuff\">Purple Stuff<\/a> and advertising the Page by running Marketplace Ads.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Soon, he noticed the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mypurplestuff\">Page<\/a> was fostering a lot of interactions with both existing and potential consumers. One customer posted on the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mypurplestuff\">Page<\/a> that she had grown to like the beverage so much that she was drinking Purple Stuff every day. She also posted that she even wore a shirt to school with the company\u2019s name on it once a week. This post alone generated over 100 Likes. Shortly thereafter, her friends wanted shirts too.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>\u201cWe send out fans on quests to tell us what displays look like in stores, what flavors they carry, if they are out of stock, what the store clerk thinks about the product, and on and on,\u201d says Tim. \u201cThey are our boots on the ground and they are honest, hard-working and innovative.\u201d<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mypurplestuff\">Purple Stuff Page<\/a> has also become a place where consumers share ideas, photos and personal videos about their experiences with the brand. When Tim has run campaigns promoting Purple Stuff, he has created a variety of Facebook Ads for different promotions, giveaways and local events.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In one campaign, the company promoted a photo contest in Arizona that allowed consumers to win Purple Stuff products and cash prizes. It also held an event during which customers were able to get free Purple Stuff soda by visiting the company\u2019s truck and uttering the phrase \u201cSpike said I can have free Purple Stuff!\u201d With these incentives in the ad text coupled with a bright purple image of the soda, Tim quickly attracted thousands of consumers in a matter of days. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>After testing several different ads, he has learned that his core target audience on Facebook is 13- to 35-year-olds, with 60 percent of them being female.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Purple Stuff started off being carried in only a few stores in its original location, Texas. By the first quarter of 2011, Purple Stuff was available in more than 5,000 stores.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As of mid April 2011, the company had gained more than 145,000 fans to its <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mypurplestuff\">Page<\/a>, giving the company a large base of brand loyalists with whom to engage and gather feedback. As importantly, its activities on Facebook are also leading to sales.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>\u201cWe drive foot traffic to stores that carry Purple Stuff and the retailers are amazed that we can do it at will and within hours of posting that it is available at their store now,\u201d says Tim.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Tim plans to continue to use Facebook Ads to promote his product and to expand the awareness and distribution of the brand among even more people and stores across the country. \u201cFacebook is as important to our brand as our company website in terms of effectiveness and excitement\u201d Tim says.<\/p><br /><\/div>",

Advertising Week is special here at Facebook because it offers us the opportunity to share key milestones and discuss what we will be focusing on in the future.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>I wanted to share a couple of key highlights from the week. During her keynote, our COO Sheryl Sandberg underlined that the web is ultimately about people and that amazing things can happen when people connect with one another and the things they care about online.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Sheryl reinforced that brands are part of the connections that people form online. Facebook enables brands not just to talk at their customers but to listen and build authentic relationships.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The power that comes from friends telling friends about your brand on Facebook allows brands to do real word<strong>-<\/strong>of<strong>-<\/strong>mouth marketing at scale for the first time.

            "message": "<div><p>Why is Warehouse 31\u2019s Jack-o\u2019-lantern smiling? Because in 2009, Chester Lee of social media company Creative Links ran Facebook Ads for a haunted house in St. Augustine, Florida called Warehouse 31. Using Facebook targeting that enabled the company to direct its ads to likely visitors based on their location and \u2018Likes and Interests\u2019, Warehouse 31\u2019s Facebook Page  <strong>(<\/strong><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Warehouse31\">http://www.facebook.com/Warehouse31<\/a><strong>)<\/strong> attracted more than 2,200 fans. As a result, many of these people ended up visiting Warehouse 31.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>This year, Chester is using friend of connection targeting -- a targeting filter that allows advertisers to target friends of people who are connected to their Page, Group, or Event -- to attract people to the Warehouse 31 Page.<strong> <\/strong><\/p><p> <\/p><p>Warehouse 31 is said to be Florida\u2019s largest indoor haunted house. Filled with intense decorations and graphic scenes, the property and its contents are all designed to spook big time.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Things at this fright house got started in September 2009 when Red Mountain Entertainment, an event promotions company, teamed up with Chester to promote Warehouse 31. As a first step, Chester created a Page<strong> <\/strong> for the haunted house. He then decided to promote the Page with Facebook Ads and used location and age targeting (users between 13 and 24).<\/p><p> <\/p><p>In addition, he used \u2018Likes and Interests\u2019 targeting with keywords related to Halloween. Eventually, the Page generated more than 2,200 connections. Soon after, Chester created an additional tab on the house\u2019s Page, featuring a coupon that people could use for admission into Warehouse 31.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Thanks to Creative Links\u2019 successful campaign in 2009, the company decided to advertise its Page again this year. However, it decided to use the friends of connection targeting filter. What&#039;s more, it provided a  \u201cBuy One Get One Free\u201d offer in its ad text to anyone who connected to its Page.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>As of mid October, more than 5,000 people had connected to the Page<strong> <\/strong>. Chester is hoping more people will be able to enjoy Warehouse 31 this year. \u201cFacebook Ads are scary good!\u201d he says.<\/p><p><span class=\"photo photo_right\"><img class=\"photo_img img\" src=\"https://fbcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/33620_491397036336_1963137_a.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><\/span><\/p><\/div>",

            "message": "<div><p>Today, Facebook announced the forthcoming availability of usernames for user profiles and Facebook Pages beginning at 12:01am Saturday, June 13, 2009. Now you can have a personalized URL for your Page (facebook.com/yourname). <br /><br />Read the Facebook blog to learn all the details: <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=90316352130\">http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=90316352130<\/a><br /><br />Below is an FAQ specifically for Page administrators on the new process and how to obtain a username for your Page. <br /><br /><b>How can I secure a Username for my Page?<\/b>                        <br />If you are an administrator of a Facebook Page, you will be able to choose your username just like a user selecting a username for their profile. There will be an interface available beginning at 12:01am EST on Saturday, June 13 for you to choose usernames for the Pages you administer.<br /><br /><b>I tried to secure a name for my Page but Facebook said the Page was not eligible. What are the requirements?<\/b><br />Your Facebook Page must meet two requirements: it must be live on Facebook prior to the May 31, 2009 cut-off date and have a minimum 1,000 fans as of May 31, 2009. <br /><br /><b>I am an administrator for multiple Pages on Facebook, how can I secure a Username for each of them?<\/b>                                      <br />If you are an administrator of a Page, you will be able to choose a username for each Page at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">http://www.facebook.com<\/a> beginning at 12:01am EST on Saturday, June 13. There will be an interface for you to choose usernames for the Facebook Pages you administer.<br /><br /><b>Why should I register a username for my Facebook Page?<\/b>             <br />Usernames allow public entities to easily promote your presence on Facebook with a short URL (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/yourname\">http://www.facebook.com/yourname<\/a>). This username can be used in your marketing communications, company website and business cards.<br /><br /><b>What are the guidelines around creating a username for Facebook Pages?<\/b>         <br />Usernames were created to make it easier for Facebook users to identify their profile and share with others. As a public figure, business or brand with a Page on Facebook, your username should be straightforward and easy to remember. Facebook encourages you to consider the following when creating a username for Pages:<br />\u2022\tCreate a username that is as close as possible to your public figure or business name (e.g. AshtonKutcher, PizzaHut). <br />\u2022\tIf you own the rights to a given name, make it your username so that others cannot obtain it. <br />\u2022\tUsernames can only contain alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9) or a period (&quot;.&quot;). <br />\u2022\tChoose a username you will be happy with for the long term.  Usernames are not transferable.<br />\u2022\tYour username must adhere to Facebook\u2019s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities. <br /><br /><b>I accidentally selected the wrong/misspelled username for my Facebook Page.  Can I revise it?<\/b>             <br />No. Once you have claimed a username by clicking the \u201cSet Username\u201d button, it is not possible to edit it, or to transfer your username to a different account on Facebook. Additionally, when an account is removed from the site, its username will not be made available to other users for security reasons.<br /><br /><b>Can I have more than one username for a Facebook Page?<\/b>                      <br />No. Only one username is allowed per Page.               <br /><br /><b>What should I do if someone\u2019s username infringes my rights?<\/b>               <br />If you wish to report that someone\u2019s username infringes your rights, please fill out our automated IP infringement form.  The form is located at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/copyright.php?noncopyright_notice=1\">http://www.facebook.com/copyright.php?noncopyright_notice=1<\/a><br /><br /><b>I am an authorized representative for a public figure, brand or business and/or hold the rights to a trademark name. My username was claimed by another user. What can I do?<\/b><br />If you wish to report that someone\u2019s username infringes your rights, please fill out our automated IP infringement form: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/copyright.php?noncopyright_notice=1\">http://www.facebook.com/copyright.php?noncopyright_notice=1<\/a><br /><br /><b>I would like to prevent individuals from registering a username that is associated with a trademark that I own.<\/b>                                   <br />To prevent the registration of a username that infringes your trademark, please go here: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=username_rights\">http://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=username_rights<\/a><br /><br /><b>What is the process to request removal of an unauthorized Page of a public figure, brand or business?<\/b><br />If you wish to report that someone\u2019s username infringes your rights, all you need to do is fill out our automated IP infringement form: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/copyright.php?noncopyright_notice=1\">http://www.facebook.com/copyright.php?noncopyright_notice=1<\/a><br /><br /><b>Will usernames such as \u201cflowers\u201d or \u201cpizza\u201d ever be available for Facebook Pages? Can I sign up on a waiting list?<\/b>                                   <br />At this time, generic words are not available as usernames.

But, we also know that students are bombarded with media each day.  We needed to engage with students in a way that would be fun, show them what they could do with our products, as well as let them know about the discount.<br /><br />To do this, we launched \u201cReal or Fake\u201d, a game embedded on our Facebook page that challenged users to determine whether a photo was real or \u201cfake\u201d (edited with Photoshop).  The game was produced by Traction.  It is no longer live on the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/adobe\">Adobe Page on Facebook<\/a> but for a live demo please <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fshowcase.tractionco.com%2Freal-or-fake%2F&amp;h=cAQHiAJ5n&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" onmouseover=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/showcase.tractionco.com\\/real-or-fake\\/&quot;);\" onclick=\"LinkshimAsyncLink.swap(this, &quot;http:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/l.php?u=http\\u00253A\\u00252F\\u00252Fshowcase.tractionco.com\\u00252Freal-or-fake\\u00252F&amp;h=cAQHiAJ5n&amp;s=1&quot;);\" target=\"_blank\">click here.<\/a><br /><br />The game lasted for 4 weeks, with 5 photos being posted each week.  If a photo had been edited with Photoshop, a tutorial showed how that was done.  And, at the end of the game, users were presented with information about Adobe Student Editions and there were 3 primary call-to-actions:  1) \u201cBuy Now\u201d, 2) \u201cPlay Again\u201d and 3) \u201cShare\u201d the game with others.<br /><br /><span class=\"photo \"><img class=\"photo_img img\" src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/3256_90231551336_2687812_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><\/span><span class=\"photo \"><img class=\"photo_img img\" src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/3256_90231686336_6305553_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><\/span><span class=\"photo \"><img class=\"photo_img img\" src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc3/3256_90231716336_2780289_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><\/span><b>Results:<\/b>  This game launched in November 2008 and ran for one month.  Social ads on Facebook ran during the first two weeks.  About 10% of our page visitors played the game and, of those who played, 6% clicked the &quot;Share&quot; button at the end of the game, and 6% clicked &quot;Buy Now&quot; at the end of the game.  Due to this game and media placement, our page received over 6,000 new fans too.  <br /><br /><b>Lessons Learned:<\/b><br /><br /><i>Engage, engage, engage (and deliver):<\/i>  By engaging with students with Real or Fake, we were able to draw attention to the launch of Adobe Student Editions, let students know about low pricing for them and we also showed them what they can do with our products.<br /><br /><i>Content and sharing:<\/i>  The game was appealing because of its fun content, and easy-to-play game.  We knew students were engaged when a discussion board started with people posting what photos they were guessing correctly or incorrectly.<br /><br /><i>Integrate with media:<\/i>  Facebook\u2019s targeted, engaging, and social ads let us get the word out; the success of this game was tied to having an integrated media strategy at the same time as launching the game.<br /><\/div>",

If you want to offer richer functionality, then do so on your website and implement either Share or Connect so visitors can share back with their friends on Facebook.

The reality is that the majority of your fans\u2019 consumption and interaction with your content will happen with posts to your \u201cWall\u201d because your Wall posts go directly to the fans\u2019 homepage.  Fewer fans will interact with what you put in your other tabs.<br /><br />Here is an example from Starbucks where they ask fans to share their thoughts on a new product on their Discussions tab.  They received over 16,000 pieces of feedback directly on the Wall post and just over 100 pieces of feedback in Starbucks\u2019 Discussions tab.  The explanation is simple \u2013 it is much easier for fans to interact with you from their homepage versus visiting your Page and having to go to a tab.  Of course, you may get deeper and richer interactions on the tab, but you will likely get fewer.<br /><br />To get started, don\u2019t worry about building out your Page\u2019s tabs, but rather just focus on posting interesting messages, links, photos, and videos to your Wall.<br /><br /><span class=\"photo \"><img class=\"photo_img img\" src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/2749_86709491336_1984840_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><\/span><span class=\"photo \"><img class=\"photo_img img\" src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/2749_86709511336_5213831_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><\/span><i>Post by <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/chrispan\">Chris Pan.<\/a><\/i><\/p><\/div>",
