# AppEngine (module)
Module enabling the support of the async connections in Google App Engine.

Google App Engine doesn't support threads but provides instead a TaskQueueing system allowing tasks to be run in the
background.

This module replaces the async system provided by default with one relying on the tasks.

__This module is not useful outside of Google App Engine.__

## Usage

This module provides a new `RavenFactory` which replaces the default async system with a GAE compatible one.

The queue size and thread options will not be used as they are specific to the default multithreaded system.

It is necessary to force the raven factory name to `com.getsentry.raven.appengine.AppEngineRavenFactory`.

### Queue name

By default, the default task queue will be used, but it's possible to specify which one will be used with the
`raven.async.gae.queuename` option:

### Connection name

As the queued tasks are sent across different instances of the application, it's important to be able to identify which
connection should be used when processing the event.
To do so, the GAE module will identify each connection based on an identifier either automatically generated or user defined.
TO manually set the connection identifier (only used internally) use the option `raven.async.connectionid`:
