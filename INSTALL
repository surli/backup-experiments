2. Compile sources
 
2.1 Building sources with tests

Note: building midPoint with the tests takes considerably long time (approx. 1 hour)

2.2 Building sources without tests

   mvn install -DskipTests=true

2.3 Compiled war file

After the build is complete the distribution archives are available in:

   dist/target/

The war file is also located in the following place:

   gui/admin-gui/target/midpoint.war

2.4 Deploy war file

Please deploy it to your Tomcat application server (copying midpoint.war to
<tomcat>/webapps should do the trick) or to other supported web container.

2.5 Access the GUI

MidPoint web GUI should be accessible few moments after the web container
starts and the application initialization is done. It is accessible on following
URL by default:

  http://<hostname>:<port>/midpoint

where <hostname> and <port> are the hostname and port number of the web container.
