[[dashboard-introduction]]
== Introduction

Spring Cloud Data Flow provides a browser-based GUI and it currently includes 6 tabs:

* **Apps** Lists all available applications and provides the control to register/unregister them
* **Runtime** Provides the Data Flow cluster view with the list of all running applications
* **Streams** List, create, deploy, and destroy Stream Definitions
ifndef::omit-tasks-docs[]
* **Tasks** List, create, launch and destroy Task Definitions
endif::omit-tasks-docs[]
* **Jobs** Perform Batch Job related functions
* **Analytics** Create data visualizations for the various analytics applications

Upon starting Spring Cloud Data Flow, the Dashboard is available at:

`\http://<host>:<port>/dashboard`

For example: http://localhost:9393/dashboard[http://localhost:9393/dashboard]

If you have enabled https, then it will be located at `\https://localhost:9393/dashboard`.
If you have enabled security, a login form is available at `\http://localhost:9393/dashboard/#/login`.

NOTE: The default Dashboard server port is `9393`

[[dashboard-apps]]
== Apps

The _Apps_ section of the Dashboard lists all the available applications and
provides the control to register/unregister them (if applicable). It is possible
to import a number of applications at once using the *Bulk Import Applications* action.

.List of Available Applications
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-available-apps-list.png[List of available applications, scaledwidth="100%"]

=== Bulk Import of Applications

The bulk import applications page provides numerous options for defining and importing a set of
applications in one go. For bulk import the application definitions are expected to be
expressed in a properties style:

`<type>.<name> = <coordinates>`

For example:

`task.timestamp=maven://org.springframework.cloud.task.app:timestamp-task:1.2.0.RELEASE`

`processor.transform=maven://org.springframework.cloud.stream.app:transform-processor-rabbit:1.2.0.RELEASE`

At the top of the bulk import page an _Uri_ can be specified that points to a properties file stored elsewhere, it
should contain properties formatted as above. Alternatively, using the textbox labeled _Apps as Properties_
it is possible to directly list each property string. Finally, if the properties are stored in a local file
the _Select Properties File_ option will open a local file browser to select the file. After setting your definitions
via one of these routes, click *Import*.

At the bottom of the page there are quick links to the property files for common groups of stream apps and
task apps. If those meet your needs, simply select your appropriate variant (rabbit, kafka, docker, etc) and
click the *Import* action on those lines to immediately import all those applications.

.Bulk Import Applications

[[dashboard-runtime]]
== Runtime
The _Runtime_ section of the Dashboard application shows the Spring Cloud Data Flow
cluster view with the list of all running applications. For each runtime app the
state of the deployment and the number of deployed instances is shown.
A list of the used deployment properties is available by clicking on the
app id.

.List of Running Applications
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-runtime.png[List of running applications, scaledwidth="100%"]

[[dashboard-streams]]
== Streams

The _Streams_ section of the Dashboard provides the _Definitions_ tab that provides
a listing of Stream definitions. There you have the option to *deploy* or *undeploy*
those stream definitions. Additionally you can remove the definition by clicking on *destroy*.
Each row includes an arrow on the left, which can be clicked to see a visual representation
of the definition. Hovering over the boxes in the visual representation will show more details
about the apps including any options passed to them. In this screenshot the timer stream has
been expanded to show the visual representation:

.List of Stream Definitions
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-streams-list-definitions.png[List of Stream Definitions, scaledwidth="100%"]

If the *details* button is clicked the view will change to show a visual representation of that
stream and also any related streams.  In the above example, if clicking *details* for the timer stream, the
view will change to the one shown below which clearly shows the relationship between the three streams (two of
them are tapping into the timer stream).

.Stream Details Page
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-stream-details.png[Stream Details Page, scaledwidth="100%"]

[[dashboard-flo-streams-designer]]
== Create Stream
The _Create Stream_ section of the Dashboard includes the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-flo[Spring Flo] designer tab that provides the canvas application, offering a interactive graphical interface for creating data pipelines.

In this tab, you can:

* Create, manage, and visualize stream pipelines using DSL, a graphical canvas, or both
* Write pipelines via DSL with content-assist and auto-complete
* Use auto-adjustment and grid-layout capabilities in the GUI for simpler and interactive organization of pipelines

Watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78CgV46OstI[screencast] that highlights some of the "Flo for Spring Cloud Data Flow" capabilities. Spring Flo https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-flo/wiki[wiki] includes more detailed content on core Flo capabilities.

ifndef::omit-tasks-docs[]
[[dashboard-tasks]]
== Tasks

The _Tasks_ section of the Dashboard currently has three tabs:

* Apps
* Definitions
* Executions

[[dashboard-tasks-apps]]
=== Apps

_Apps_ encapsulate a unit of work into a reusable component. Within the Data Flow
runtime environment _Apps_ allow users to create definitions for _Streams_ as
well as _Tasks_. Consequently, the _Apps_ tab within the _Tasks_ section
allows users to create _Task_ definitions.

NOTE: You will also use this tab to create Batch Jobs.

.List of Task Apps
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-task-apps-list.png[List of Task Apps, scaledwidth="100%"]

On this screen you can perform the following actions:

* View details such as the task app options.
* Create a Task Definition from the respective App.

==== Create a Task Definition from a selected Task App

On this screen you can create a new Task Definition. As a minimum you must provide a
name for the new definition. You will also have the option
to specify various properties that are used during the deployment of the app.

NOTE: Each parameter is only included if the _Include_ checkbox is selected.

==== View Task App Details

On this page you can view the details of a selected task app,
including the list of available options (properties) for that app.

[[dashboard-task-definition]]
=== Definitions

This page lists the Data Flow Task definitions and provides actions to *launch*
or *destroy* those tasks. It also provides a shortcut operation to define
one or more tasks using simple textual input, indicated by
the *bulk define tasks* button.

.List of Task Definitions
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-task-definitions-list.png[List of Task Definitions, scaledwidth="100%"]

==== Creating Task Definitions using the bulk define interface

After pressing *bulk define tasks*, the following screen will
be shown.

.Bulk Define Tasks
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-bulk-define-tasks.png[Bulk Define Tasks, scaledwidth="100%"]

It includes a textbox where one or more definitions can be entered
and then various actions performed on those definitions.
The required input text format for task definitions is very basic, each line should be
of the form:

`<task-definition-name> = <task-application> <options>`

For example:

`demo-timestamp = timestamp --format=hhmmss`

After entering any data a validator will run asynchronously to
verify both the syntax and that the application name entered is
a valid application and it supports the options
specified. If validation fails the editor will show the errors with more
information via tooltips.

To make it easier to enter definitions into the text area, content assist is
supported. Pressing *Ctrl+Space* will invoke content assist to suggest
simple task names (based on the line on which it is invoked), task applications
and task application options. Press ESCape to close the content assist
window without taking a selection.

If the validator should not verify the applications or the options
(for example if specifying non-whitelisted options to the
applications) then turn off that part of validation by toggling the checkbox
off on the *Verify Apps* button - the validator will then only perform
syntax checking.  When correctly validated, the *create* button will
be clickable and on pressing it the UI will proceed to create each task definition. If there
are any errors during creation then after creation finishes the
editor will show any lines of input, as it cannot be used in task definitions.
These can then be fixed up and creation repeated.  There is an
*import file* button to open a file browser on the
local file system if the definitions are in a file and it is easier
to import than copy/paste.

NOTE: Bulk loading of composed task definitions is not currently supported.

==== Creating Composed Task Definitions
The dashboard includes the Create Composed Task tab that provides the canvas
application, offering a interactive graphical interface for creating
composed tasks.

In this tab, you can:

* Create and visualize composed tasks using DSL, a graphical canvas, or both
* Use auto-adjustment and grid-layout capabilities in the GUI for simpler and
interactive organization of the composed task

.Composed Task Designer
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-ctr-flo-tab.png[Composed Task Designer, scaledwidth="100%"]

==== Launching Tasks

Once the task definition is created, they can be launched through the Dashboard
as well. Navigate to the *Definitions* tab. Select the Task you want to launch by
pressing `Launch`.

On the following screen, you can define one or more Task parameters by entering:

* Parameter Key
* Parameter Value

Task parameters are not typed.

[[dashboard-tasks-executions]]
=== Executions

.List of Task Executions
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-task-executions-list.png[List of Task Executions, scaledwidth="100%"]

[[dashboard-jobs]]
== Jobs

The _Jobs_ section of the Dashboard allows you to inspect *Batch Jobs*. The main
section of the screen provides a list of Job Executions. *Batch Jobs*
are *Tasks* that were executing one or more *Batch Job*. As such each
Job Execution has a back reference to the *Task Execution Id* (Task Id).

In case of a failed job, you can also restart the task. When dealing with long-running
Batch Jobs, you can also request to stop it.

.List of Job Executions
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-job-executions-list.png[List of Job Executions, scaledwidth="100%"]

[[dashboard-job-executions-list]]
=== List job executions

This page lists the Batch Job Executions and provides the option to *restart* or *stop* a specific job execution, provided the operation is available.
Furthermore, you have the option to view the Job execution details.

The list of Job Executions also shows the state of the underlying Job Definition.
Thus, if the underlying definition has been deleted, _deleted_ will be shown.

[[dashboard-job-executions-details]]
==== Job execution details

.Job Execution Details
image::{dataflow-asciidoc}/images/dataflow-jobs-job-execution-details.png[Job Execution Details, scaledwidth="100%"]

The Job Execution Details screen also contains a list of the executed steps. You can
further drill into the _Step Execution Details_ by clicking onto the magnifying glass.

[[dashboard-job-executions-steps]]
==== Step execution details

On the top of the page, you will see progress indicator the respective step, with
the option to refresh the indicator. Furthermore, a link is provided to view the
_step execution history_.

The Step Execution details screen provides a complete list of all Step Execution
Context key/value pairs.

IMPORTANT: In case of exceptions, the _Exit Description_ field will contain
additional error information. Please be aware, though, that this field can only
have a maximum of *2500 characters*. Therefore, in case of long exception
stacktraces, trimming of error messages may occur. In that case, please refer to
the server log files for further details.

[[dashboard-job-executions-steps-progress]]
==== Step Execution Progress

On this screen, you can see a progress bar indicator in regards to the execution
of the current step. Under the *Step Execution History*, you can also view various
metrics associated with the selected step such as *duration*, *read counts*, *write
counts* etc.

.Step Execution History

[[dashboard-analytics]]
== Analytics

The _Analytics_ section of the Dashboard provided data visualization capabilities
for the various analytics applications available in _Spring Cloud Data Flow_:

* Counters
* Field-Value Counters
* Aggregate Counters

For example, if you create a stream with a link:https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/counter/tree/master/spring-cloud-starter-stream-sink-counter[Counter] application, you can now easily create the corresponding
graph from within the **Dashboard** tab:

1. Under `Metric Type`, select `Counters` from the select box
2. Under `Stream`, select `tweetcount`
3. Under `Visualization`, select the desired chart option, `Bar Chart`

Using the icons to the right, you can add additional charts to the Dashboard,
re-arange the order of created dashboards or remove data visualizations.
