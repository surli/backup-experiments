Config for Elastic Search 5.2.2+ Setup Ubuntu

1. Install Elasticsearch v5.2.2 / Kibana

wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-5.2.2.deb
dpkg -i elasticsearch-5.2.2.deb

wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/kibana-5.2.2.deb
dpkg -i kibana-5.2.2.deb

2. Install Oracle Java JDK 1.8.0_73 or later (Vagrant boxes need to be upgraded). Lucene has an issue with Java JDK < 1.8.0_73
apt-get update
apt-get install python-software-properties
add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
apt-get update
apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

3. Setup elasticsearch.yml for performance /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml. This is needed to boost performance.
the *.size gives more power to Elastic since you give it number of cores. If you have an 8 core box you probably want to
give most of it to Elastic for searching. If you are indexing, increase bulk higher.

#elasticsearch.yml - set size to # of cores
#for search operation
thread_pool.search.size: 2
thread_pool.search.queue_size: 2000

#for bulk operations
thread_pool.bulk.size: 2
thread_pool.bulk.queue_size: 1000

#for indexing operations
thread_pool.index.size: 2
thread_pool.index.queue_size: 1000

# Force all memory to be locked, forcing the JVM to never swap. This is recommended - no  swappiness on Elastic.
bootstrap.memory_lock: true

# Indices settings - The default of 10% is too low in general and this is recommended to cache more.
indices.memory.index_buffer_size: 30%

network.host: 172.28.128.XXX
http.port: 9200

4. Set - this sets the memory so that Elastic does not hang.
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

In /etc/sysctl.conf
vm.max_map_count = 262144

sysctl -p

5. Set memory edit jvm.options file: set half of memory - "/etc/init.d/solr stop" to save mem since you are using elastic now.
-Xms2g
-Xmx2g

6. Start /etc/security/limits.conf - Need to give root and elasticsearch user more open files, and nproc for threads.
root - nofile 100000
elasticsearch  -  nofile  65536
elasticsearch	-	nproc	5000
root	-	nproc	5000

 7. Uncomment /etc/pam.d/su on Ubuntu - you need to do that on Unbuntu or it won't use limits.conf
 # session    required   pam_limits.so

 8. Start Elastic -- also set to auto start
 /etc/init.d/elasticsearch start

 Check http://localhost:9200/_nodes/stats/process?filter_path=**.max_file_descriptor
 Check http://localhost:9200/_nodes?filter_path=**.mlockall

 9. You should run Kibana since that is how most people interface with Elastic
 /etc/init.d/kibana start

 10. See example-tomcat-context.xml for Sample config
