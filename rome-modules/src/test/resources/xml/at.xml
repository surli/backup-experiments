My late mother used to tell me affectionately, &amp;quotEdward, you are smart,&amp;quot but then she would say, &amp;quotBut not enough.&amp;quot  Truth be told, there were a number of occasions of late where she proved to be right, but we're talking here about art, not my personal life---aren't we?

	    <title>Does Tim Hawkinson Have Multiple Personalities?</title>

	    <description>The opening of Tim Hawkinson's exhibition at LACMA a couple of weeks ago turned into an event memorable not only as a chance to celebrate the work of one of the most inventive artists working today, but also an occasion to observe a crowd behaving in a most unusual way: with goofy smiles on their faces, adult men and women were giggling or intently staring in total disbelief.   And let me admit for the record that, as for myself, I was guilty on both counts.

	    <title>The Explosion of New Museums: Too Much of a Good Thing?</title>

For example, I would never complain that there are too many museums in Rome or in Paris.   But I would be wary of a phenomenon of a hundred new museums springing up in a short period of time in one country...  </description>

	    <description>So much has been said and written about the whirlwind King Tut exhibition--launched last week here at LACMA--that I hesitated initially to talk about it. I thought, &amp;quotWhy add to all this white noise?&amp;quot But after the totally disagreeable experience of attending the gala opening, followed, a few days later, by walking through the exhibition with the curator, I am filled with conflicting emotions.</description>
