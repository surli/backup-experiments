// Image Mixins
// - Responsive image
// - Retina image


// Responsive image
//

  height: auto; // Part 2: Scale the height according to the width, otherwise you get stretching
}


// Retina image
//
// Short retina mixin for setting background-image and -size. Note that the
// spelling of `min--moz-device-pixel-ratio` is intentional.
