/**
 *
 * The ADM (Amazon Device Messaging) support is still experimental in the UnifiedPush Server.
 * ADM Push Network connection is implemented on the server side but the client SDK is not yet there.
 * You can find more information about ADM on the client side here :
 * https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/engage/device-messaging/tech-docs/04-integrating-your-app-with-adm
 * To register "manually" to the UnifiedPush Service you will need these values :
 * - pushServerURL: "{{ contextPath }}"
 * - variantID: "{{ variant.variantID }}",
 * - variantSecret: "{{ variant.secret }}"
 * The endpoint to register is documented here :
 * https://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-unifiedpush-rest/registry/device/index.html
