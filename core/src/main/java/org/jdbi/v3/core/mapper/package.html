<code>mapper</code>s take the JDBC ResultSet and produce Java results.
ColumnMappers inspect a single result column, and RowMappers inspect the
entire result row to build a compound type.  Mappers are composeable and
often will feed results into the <code>collector</code> package to produce
the end result.
