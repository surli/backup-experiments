<p>
The <code>transaction</code> package implements the strategy
<code>Jdbi</code> uses to open and close transactions.  The default
instance simply sets the transaction property on the connection.
There is also a runner that runs <code>SERIALIZABLE</code> transactions
repeatedly until they succeed without transient serialization failures.
