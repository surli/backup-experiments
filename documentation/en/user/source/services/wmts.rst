WMTS - Web Map Tiling Service
=============================

The Web Map Tiling Service, or WMTS for short, is an OGC standard currently undergoing ratification.

GeoWebCache fully implements WMTS using KVP, and is seeking funding for the RESTful and SOAP based approaches.

On the front page of your GeoWebCache instance you will find a link to the WMTS GetCapabilities document.
