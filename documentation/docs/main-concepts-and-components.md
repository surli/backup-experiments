title: Main concepts and components&#58;
---

1) A [**client**](clients.html) represents an authentication mechanism (flow). It performs the login process and returns a user profile. An indirect client is for UI authentication while a direct client is for web services authentication

2) An [**authenticator**](authenticators.html) is required for HTTP clients to validate credentials. It is a subcomponent of a `ProfileService` which validates credentials but also handles the creation, update, and removal of users 

3) An [**authorizer**](authorizers.html) is meant to check authorizations on the authenticated user profile(s) or on the current web context

4) A [**matcher**](matchers.html) defines whether the security must apply on the **security filter**

5) A [**config**](config.html) defines the security configuration via clients, authorizers and matchers

---

6) A [**user profile**](user-profile.html) is the profile of the authenticated user. It has an identifier, attributes, roles, permissions, a "remember-me" nature and a linked identifier

---

7) The [**web context**](session-store.html) is an abstraction of the HTTP request and response specific to the *pac4j* implementation and the associated `SessionStore` represents an implementation of the session


8) The ["**security filter**"](how-to-implement-pac4j-for-a-new-framework.html#a-secure-an-url) (or whatever the mechanism used to intercept HTTP requests) protects an URL by checking that the user is authenticated and that the authorizations are valid, according to the clients and authorizers configuration. If the user is not authenticated, it performs authentication for direct clients or starts the login process for indirect clients

9) The ["**callback controller**"](how-to-implement-pac4j-for-a-new-framework.html#b-handle-callback-for-indirect-client) finishes the login process for an indirect client

10) The [**logout controller**"](how-to-implement-pac4j-for-a-new-framework.html#c-logout) handles the application and/or the identity server logouts
