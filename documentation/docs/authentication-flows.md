## 1) UI authentication (stateful/indirect client)

`pac4j` supports **UI authentication, that is stateful/indirect client**: the user is redirected to the external identity provider, logs in and is finally redirected back to the application.

## 2) Web services authentication (stateless/direct client)

`pac4j` also supports **web services authentication, that is stateless/direct client**: credentials are passed with the HTTP request and an `Authenticator` must be defined to validate the credentials (a specific `ProfileCreator` can also be defined to get the user profile from another source).
