Set of scripts to facilitate parallel project synchronization and mirroring

Use e.g. like this:

  # sync.py -c /scripts/sync.conf -d /ws-local/ -p

where the sync.conf file contents might look like this:

  {
     "commands": [["/usr/opengrok/bin/Messages", "-c", "info", "-e", "+1 hour",
                   "-n", "normal", "-t", "ARG", "resync + reindex in progress"],
                  ["sudo", "-u", "wsmirror", "/scripts/mirror-project.ksh"],
                  ["sudo", "-u", "webservd", "/scripts/reindex-project.ksh",
                   "/opengrok/etc/opengrok.conf", "/usr/opengrok/bin"],
                  ["/usr/opengrok/bin/Messages", "-n", "abort", "-t"],
                  ["/scripts/check-indexer-logs.ksh"]]
  }

The commands got appended project name unless one of their arguments is equal
to 'ARG', in which case it is substituted with project name and no append is
done.

For per-project reindexing to work properly, reindex-project.ksh uses
the logging.properties.template to make sure each project has its own
log directory.
