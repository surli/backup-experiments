## Changes in `0.16.0`

Check out the [0.16.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A%0.16.0+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

***Important***

The next release of Singularity (`0.17.0`) will contain a bump to mesos 1.1.2. Any critical bug fixes will be backported to `0.16` for a short period. See [#1571](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1571) for more details on the upcoming upgrade

### New Endpoints

[1559](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1559) Added two additional endpoints to more easily track the lifecyle of a task. Both endpoints return a `SingularityTaskState` object with basic details about the current state of the task

  - `/track/task/{taskId}` - for tracking active tasks which have already been assigned an id
  - `/track/run/{requestId}/{runId}` - For tracking tasks by `runId` (e.g. an `ON_DEMAND` task). This endpoint can also search pending tasks
