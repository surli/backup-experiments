'''Kre M’Baye''', also known as Amadou (or Armedy) Kre M’Baye, is a Senegalese artist and art instructor. He was born Andy Keve in [[Dakar, Senegal]] on April 25, 1949. He was nicknamed “Kere” or “Kre” even as a primary school child because he used to draw constantly on the classroom blackboard with chalk. Since 1969 he has been an associate of celebrated [[Africa]]n artists such as Ibou Diouf, Mamadou Niang, Seidou Barry, Mor Faye (father of Ousmane Faye) and Art College professor Pierre Lods. 

In 1974 he played the head of a gang in the well-received movie ''Baks (Yamba)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.africine.org/%3Fmenu%3Dfilm%26no%3D6942&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dbaks%2BYamba%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DtEJ Africine Website]&lt;/ref&gt; produced by Momar Thiam, but abandoned his acting career in favor of his career as an artist. His first exhibition in 1976 at the Dynamique Museum of Dakar was highly acclaimed, his painting “The Messenger” receiving particular praise by President [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]]. 

Some of his best-known works are his portraits of women inspired by the face of his mother Fari Fate (Mame Fari),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/11/11/EBG2AFIHKH1.DTL San Francisco Chronicle ''Emeryville: Gallery Gives Rare Spotlight to West African Art'' by Rick DelVecchio, San Francisco Chronicle Nov. 11th, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; “a woman [[griot]] of great renown; a fascinating storyteller of Senegalese history”. Very stylish, full of exuberance and cheerfulness, Fari Fate with her jewelries, her meticulous dresses, her elaborate hairstyles, inspired to the artist a painting style full of fineness. M'Baye has another style that tends to abstract paintings dominated by blue and orange colors.

M'Baye is a disciple of Pierre Lods and was self-trained in the workshop of Peter Plastics Research Lods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0438/is_3_35/ai_98171011/pg_19 ''The Ecole de Dakar: Pan-Africanism in Paint and Textile by Elizabeth Harney (Autumn 2002) African Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Gaston Madeira formed "Netty Guy" (The Three Baobabs), bringing together Kré M'Baye, Moussa N'Diaye Baydie M'Baye and Zulu, three painters representative of the School of Arts in Dakar, who in 1998 opened a gallery on the Senegalese island of N'gor and founded Workshops N'gor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.takusaan.com/pages/neoCrea/art-ngor-present.html&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dkre%2Bmbaye%26start%3D30%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN%26pwst%3D1 Takusaan Website]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a participant in Tenq, the first workshop on the Triangle model (led by El Hadji Sy and sponsored by CBAO, [[Maersk]], SAEC and the [[British Council]], Dakar) held in West Africa, which took place at the Lycée Cheikh Oumar Fontiyou in Saint Louis, Senegal; the first event of Africa95, a year-long festival celebrating African arts in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and Africa, featuring 25 artists from 10 African countries and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trianglearts.org/detail.php?id=33&amp;more=yes Triangle Arts Trust Website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

His brother Seni M’Baye is also a noted Senegalese artist.
