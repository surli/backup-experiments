## Manual Rollup Tool

This tool allows you to manually roll up granularties from finer-grained data.  

This assumes the raw data exists to start with. If the raw data is not existing or has TTL'd out, run the Cloud File backfiller tool (link here) to first backfill 5m rollups and then calculate the rollups belonging to higher resolutions, by running this tool.


### Getting Started

An example configuration to be supplied while running the tool lies under `RollupToolConfig`. The most noteworthy settings are of the granularities to be rolled up.

Setting `METRICS_5M_ENABLED` to true will rollup 5m resolution from raw metrics, belonging to `SHARDS_TO_MANUALLY_ROLLUP` supplied shards and so on. 


### Rollup Tool Configuration Options

* `METRICS_5M_ENABLED`
* `SHARDS_TO_MANUALLY_ROLLUP`


### Notes

1. The following metrics emitted from the tool are useful:

   1. `com.rackspacecloud.blueflood.io.ManualRollup.ReRoll-Timer.mean`
      * average time spent in calculating to rollups.
   1. `com.rackspacecloud.blueflood.io.ManualRollup.Time-taken-to-rollup-per-shard.count` 
      * will give you the time spent on rolling up each shard. Also, useful in getting a count of shards as they are rolled.

1. The tool internally uses the astyanax writer, so there are other metrics especially the ones related to queue sizes, which might be helpful as well.

1. Note that enabling a granularity assumes that the rollups/raw data belonging to a finer granularity is present because it calculates the rollups belonging to enabled granularity from a finer one. In other words, if multiple granularities are enabled, they will be rolled up one by one in increasing order of granularity. This also implies that an intermediate granularity cannot be skipped unless rollups are already existing for it.


### Examples

Example run of manual rollup tool:

```
java -Dblueflood.config=file:/home/chinmay/bf-RollupTool.conf \
     -Dlog4j.configuration=file:/home/chinmay/log4jRollupTool.properties >-Xms1G -Xmx2G \
   -cp blueflood-rax-all-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.rackspacecloud.blueflood.service.RunRollupTool
```
