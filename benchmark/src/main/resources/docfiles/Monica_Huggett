Huggett’s [approach] is ravishing in its sonorities, her supporting cast adding significantly to the exotic sounds of the various scordaturas and the overall effect of her intelligent, stylish and expressive playing.” The Strad Magazine, November 2004“Huggett's playing - on three violins - shines with ease and expression” The Times“Huggett’s imaginative approach and lively response to detail are among the most rewarding aspects of her version of these emotionally rewarding pieces.” 5* BBC Music Magazine, December 2004“Of all the recordings now available of Biber...this [is] by far and away the most spectacular, exuberant, colourful and downright ravishing of them all. Huggett positively revels in the virtuosity of Biber’s original...Huggett’s beautifully crafted performance of the complex and, at times, profoundly moving solo Passacaglia rounds off what is a matchless recording from every perspective.” International Record Review, Nov 2004“No matter how many versions of the Bach violin concertos you already own, this one is a must.” International Record Review
