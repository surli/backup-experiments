K. Waterschei S.V. Thor Genk was a Belgian football club from the city of Genk, Limburg (Belgium).It was created in 1919 as Waterschei's Sport Vereeniging Thor with Thor being the acronym of Tot Herstel Onzer Rechten ("To recover our rights"). It registered to the FA only in 1925 and received the matricule n°533. The club enjoyed a spell in the first division in the late 1950s to the early 1960s and again from 1978 to 1986. After two seasons in the second division, K. Waterschei S.V. Thor Genk merged with K.F.C. Winterslag to form K.R.C. Genk.During the season 1982–83, the match Standard Liège-Waterschei had been bribed and the Standard eventually won the championship. Waterschei won the Belgian Cup twice (1980 and 1982).Quite remarkably, the latter victory led to Waterschei reaching the semi-finals of the European Cup Winners Cup in the season 1982-83. After defeating PSG in the quarter-finals, Waterschei lost the first leg of the semi-final 5–1 at Pittodrie, home of the eventual winners, Aberdeen. A 1–0 victory in Genk, courtesy of Eddy Voordeckers, could not reverse the position.Belgian Cup: 1980, 1982.Belgian Cup Finalist: 1955.
