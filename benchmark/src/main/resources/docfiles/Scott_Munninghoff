Scott Andrew Munninghoff (born December 5, 1958 in Cincinnati, Ohio) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played briefly for the Philadelphia Phillies during the 1980 season. Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m), 175 pounds (79 kg), he batted and threw right-handed.Munninghoff was drafted by the Phillies in the first round of the 1977 Major League Baseball Draft (22 overall) out of Purcell Marian High School. His professional career started off poorly, as he went 0–5 with a 5.52 earned run average for the New York–Penn League's Auburn Phillies in 1977. However, he improved to 17–7 with a 2.30 ERA in 26 starts for the 1978 Spartanburg Phillies.[1]He debuted with the Philadelphia Phillies on April 13, 1980, pitching two scoreless innings out of the bullpen against the Montreal Expos. On April 22, in his first and only plate appearance, Munninghoff hit a triple and scored a run against Tom Hausman of the New York Mets,[2] joining Eduardo Rodríguez (1973) and Eric Cammack (2000) as the only pitchers to accomplish this feat in major league history.These three players, along with Charlie Lindstrom, share the ML record of a 3.000 career slugging percentage.After a poor outing against the Los Angeles Dodgers, in which he gave up a single, wild pitch and walked two (one of which occurred with the bases loaded) Munninghoff was reassigned to the triple A Oklahoma City 89ers. In four relief appearances, Munninghoff posted a 4.50 ERA and did not have a decision or save, giving up three earned runs on eight hits and five walks while striking out two in 6.0 innings of work.Munninghoff spent the remainder of the 1980 season and all of 1981 with Oklahoma. On December 9, 1981, he was sent to the Cleveland Indians in completion of an earlier deal made on November 20, 1981 in which the Phillies sent a player to be named later to the Indians; the Indians sent catcher Bo Díaz to the Phillies; the Phillies sent Lonnie Smith to the St. Louis Cardinals, and the Cardinals sent Silvio Martinez and Lary Sorensen to the Indians. He spent one season in the Indians' organization, and pitched several seasons of independent ball before becoming a coach at Purcell Marian.Munninghoff currently owns a roofing company in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he lives with his wife and children.[3][dead link]
