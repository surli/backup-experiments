Warwickshire County Council is the county council that governs the non-metropolitan county of Warwickshire in England. Their headquarters are located at Shire Hall, Market Square, in centre of the county town of Warwick. Politically the county is divided into five districts and boroughs: North Warwickshire, Nuneaton and Bedworth, Rugby, Stratford and Warwick. The council's principal functions are county roads and rights of way, social services, education and libraries, but it also provides many other local government services in the area it covers.Prior to 1974 and the creation of the West Midlands, the county was much larger, incorporating the town of Sutton Coldfield, the semi-rural area around Meriden, the town of Solihull, the city of Coventry and much of the city of Birmingham, although these last three areas were administratively independent of the pre-1974 county council as they had their own county borough councils. The current leader of the council is Alan Farnell and the chief executive is Jim Graham.
