Connolly Drive is an arterial road in the outer northern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia. The road takes its name from the Perth suburb of Connolly, which lies just beyond the road's terminus.The road extends northerly from Shenton Avenue in Currambine, west of Joondalup's central business district, to the outer suburb of Butler. Connolly Drive runs parallel with the busier Marmion Avenue and eases its traffic flow past the end of the Mitchell Freeway at Burns Beach Road.[1]For the first 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) of its length, Connolly Drive is a four-lane dual carriageway. It reverts to 2 lanes at Clarkson, at the roundabout with Neerabup Road, but the carriageways remain separated for most of its length. The speed limit varies at different points, but never exceeds 70 km/h.Connolly Drive was exclusively a single-lane carriageway for many years until recent developments in 2007, 2010 and 2011 to upgrade the road in conjunction with the northern extension of the Mitchell Freeway. There are currently plans for Connolly Drive to be extended further north to the outer suburb of Yanchep, with the Joondalup railway line running through the median section of the road.A number of major intersections cross the road at various points. The most significant intersections are with Shenton Avenue, Burns Beach Road and Hester Avenue.[2] Most are controlled by roundabouts, with the exceptions of Shenton Avenue, Kinross Drive and Lukin Drive, which are controlled by traffic lights.Connolly Drive will be upgraded to a dual carriageway for its entire length, possibly between 2027 and 2029.Connolly Drive Kinross - being extended into Tamala Park and on up to Clarkson (June 2007).Sign showing widening of Connolly Drive up to McNaughton Crescent - Kinross (June 2007).Connolly Drive Kinross - being extended "Aerial burn planned" sign (June 2007).Connolly Drive Kinross - looking south to the widening works (June 2007).Connolly Drive's missing link between Kinross and Clarkson which opened August 2007.View north from Shenton AvenueView south to Shenton Avenue Australian Roads portalCoordinates: 31°43′47″S 115°44′42″E﻿ / ﻿31.7297°S 115.7450°E﻿ / -31.7297; 115.7450
