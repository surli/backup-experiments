The 2001 Cleveland Browns season was the team's 53rd season and 49th with the National Football League.Head coachesOffensive coachesSpecial teams coachesStrength and conditioning[1]The most notable game from the 2001 Cleveland Browns season came on a December 16 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Browns were driving toward the east end zone for what would have been the winning score. A controversial call on fourth down gave the Jaguars the ball. Browns' receiver Quincy Morgan had caught a pass for a first down on 4th and 1. After Tim Couch spiked the ball on the next play, referee Terry McAulay reviewed Morgan's catch, claiming that the replay officials had buzzed him before Couch spiked the ball. (NFL Rules state that once the next play is completed, the officials cannot under any circumstances review any previous plays.) Upon reviewing the play, McAulay determined that Morgan never had control of the ball, thus the pass was incomplete, and the Jaguars were awarded the ball. Fans in the Dawg Pound began throwing plastic beer bottles and other objects on the field.[2] McAulay declared the game over and sent the teams to the locker rooms. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue then called to override the referee's decision, sending the players back onto the field, where the Jaguars ran out the last seconds under a hail of debris.[3]Running BacksWide ReceiversTight EndsDefensive LinemenDefensive BacksSpecial TeamsThe Browns did not qualify for the postseason.2001 is the only season since the Browns have returned that had the same Quarterback start all 16 games (Tim Couch).
