He started playing music at the age of 12 after receiving his first guitar. James credits his childhood experiences in the Bay area as a strong musical influence due to the wide range of music to which he was exposed. His early interest in music was sparked by grunge artists like Nirvana, Sound Garden, and Pearl Jam, and his own music was inspired by singer-songwriter acts like Sublime, Ben Harper, Jason Mraz, and the Dave Matthews Band. California hip-hop served as inspiration that later led James to integrate freestyle rapping into music. James remains an independent artist and has financed his tours through sponsorship deals with brands like Oakley, Muscle Milk, Corona, and Honda.
