* Senior club appearances and goals counted for the domestic league only.Frederick Harris (2 July 1912 – October 1998) was an English footballer who played his whole professional career for Birmingham City.Harris was born in Solihull, Warwickshire. He joined Birmingham as an inside forward in 1933 at the age of 19. He scored on his debut in a 2-1 home win against local rivals Aston Villa. He was the club's leading scorer in 1938–39 with 14 League goals and 17 in all competitions.[1]During the Second World War he converted to play as a wing half and played out the rest of his career in that position. His strong tackling and constructive use of the ball impressed manager Harry Storer sufficiently to make him club captain.[1] He is credited with recommending Johnny Berry to Birmingham, having seen him play for an Army team while both were serving in India during the war.[2] He won representative honours for the Football League XI against the Scottish League in 1948–49.[1]He retired from football in 1950, aged nearly 38, having made 312 appearances in all competitions for Birmingham and scored 68 goals.[1]He then became a chiropodist and physiotherapist in the Solihull, Olton and Acocks Green district of Birmingham. The clinic is still run as a family practice on the Warwick Road in Olton, Solihull. Harris died in October 1998 at the age of 86.[citation needed]
