Etifoxine (INN,[3] also known as etafenoxine; trade name Stresam) is an anxiolytic and anticonvulsant drug[4] developed by Hoechst in the 1960s.[3] It is used in anxiety disorders and to promote peripheral nerve healing.[5] It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and does not bind to the benzodiazepine receptor.[6] It is more effective than lorazepam as an anxiolytic, and has fewer side effects.[7]Etifoxine has been associated with acute liver injury.[1]Unlike benzodiazepines, etifoxine appears to produce its anxiolytic effects by binding to β2 and β3 subunits of the GABAA receptor complex, and so is acting at a different target site to benzodiazepines, although the physiological effect that is produced is similar to that of benzodiazepines.[8] This difference in binding means that etifoxine can be used alongside benzodiazepines to potentiate their effects without competing for binding sites,[9] however it also means that the effects of etifoxine are not reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil.[10] (S)-Etifoxine is currently being investigated as a pain management medication. It has shown promise for chemotherapy induced pain as well as neuropathic pain, with little or no sedating side effects.[11][12][13][non-primary source needed]
