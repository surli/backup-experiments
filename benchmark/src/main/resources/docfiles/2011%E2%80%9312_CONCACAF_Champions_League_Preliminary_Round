The 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League Preliminary Round was played from July to August 2011. The first legs were played July 26–28, 2011, and the second legs were played August 2–4, 2011.[1]The draw for the Preliminary Round and the Group Stage was held on May 18, 2011, at the CONCACAF headquarters in New York City.[2] Teams from the same association (excluding "wildcard" teams which replace a team from another association) may not be drawn with each other.[3]A total of 16 teams competed, divided into eight ties. Each tie was played over two legs, and the away goals rule would be used, but not after a tie enters extra time, and so a tie would be decided by penalty shootout if the aggregate score is level after extra time. The winners of each tie advanced to the Group Stage to join the eight automatic qualifiers.[3]All Times U.S. Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−04:00)San Francisco  v  Seattle Sounders FCHerediano  v  Alpha UnitedToronto FC  v  Real EstelíIsidro Metapán  v  Puerto Rico IslandersSantos Laguna  v  OlimpiaMorelia  v  TempêteAlianza  v  FC DallasMotagua  v  MunicipalReal Estelí  v  Toronto FCToronto FC won 4–2 on aggregate.FC Dallas  v  AlianzaFC Dallas won 2–0 on aggregate.Tempête  v  MoreliaMorelia won 7–0 on aggregate.Puerto Rico Islanders  v  Isidro Metapán3–3 on aggregate.
