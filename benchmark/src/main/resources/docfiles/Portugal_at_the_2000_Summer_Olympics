Portugal competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.A delegation of 61 competitors participated in 13 sports, winning two Olympic bronze medals in the judo and athletics.[1]Fernanda Ribeiro, the 10000m champion from Atlanta'96 and in her fourth consecutive Olympics, couldn't keep her title away from the previous holder Derartu Tulu but still managed to reach the podium. The first Portuguese medal in the judo was achieved by Nuno Delgado in the –81 kg category.A much smaller delegation competed at these antipodean Games explaining the reduction in the athletics and swimming teams. Nevertheless, Portuguese archery and tennis had their third consecutive Olympic presence. But, as with badminton, these competitors were all eliminated in the first round (the tennis male team was beaten again by a bahamese team). Sailing provided good results with some finalists (5–8th) in distinct classes. Beach volleyball was again represented by the same Atlanta'96 fourth-placed male team. It was an almost a remake, as they faced some of the same adversaries, were beaten by an American team in the semi-finals and lost the chance to grab the bronze medal.Men's Individual Competition:800m:1500m:5000m:10000m:Marathon:20 km Walk:50 km Walk:400m Hurdles:3000m Steeplechase:Decathlon:Hammer Throw:Long Jump:Pole Vault:1500m:10000m:Marathon:20 km Walk:Discus Throw:Men's Singles Competition:Women's Slalom K-1:Men's Road Individual Time Trial:Men's Road Race:Individual Dressage:One male fencer represented Portugal in 2000.Men's Half Lightweight (–66 kg):Men's Lightweight (–73 kg):Men's Half Middleweight (–81 kg):Men's Half Heavyweight (–100 kg):Women's Lightweight (–57 kg):Women's Half Heavyweight (–78 kg):Sailboard (Mistral):Double-Handed Dinghy (470):Single-Handed Dinghy (Europe):Single-Handed Dinghy (Laser):Multihull (Tornado):High-Performance Double-Handed Dinghy (49er):Men's 10m Air Pistol:Men's 50m Pistol:Men's Trap:Men's 50m Freestyle:Men's 200m Freestyle:Men's 100m Butterfly:Men's 100m Breaststroke:Men's 200m Breaststroke:Men's 100m Backstroke:Men's 200m Backstroke:Women's 200m Butterfly:Men's Doubles Competition:Men's Competition:Women's Competition:
