Manuel Sadosky (April 13, 1914 – June 18, 2005) was an Argentine mathematician, born in Buenos Aires to Jewish Russian immigrants fleeing the pogroms. He is widely considered the father of computer science studies in Argentina.Son of a shoemaker, Sadosky studied at the Mariano Acosta teachers school. Noted novelist Julio Cortázar was his classmate there, and remained a longtime friend. Since his childhood he was an ardent supporter of San Lorenzo de Almagro.Sadosky graduated as a Doctor in Physics and Mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires in 1940, under supervision of Esteban Terradas. He then moved to the Henri Poincaré Institute in Paris to pursue postdoctoral studies on a scholarship granted by the French Government. After another year in Italy, he returned to Argentina, where he faced complicated employment options because of his opposition to the Peronist regime.After the coup d'état of 1955 removed Perón, he took up a position as professor at the University of Buenos Aires, where he was vice-dean of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences from 1957 to 1966.In 1960 he was commissioned to develop the Computational Institute (Instituto de Cálculo) of the university, home of Clementina (a Ferranti Mercury), the first Argentine computer for research and education.[1] He directed the institute until a coup d'état installed a military dictatorship in 1966, when he resigned in opposition to government intervention in the hitherto autonomous state universities (the Night of the Big Sticks). He moved to Uruguay, finding employment in Montevideo at the Universidad de la República, where he helped to start computer studies and to introduce the first research computer in the country.He was later able to return to Argentina, but the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance death squad threatened to kill him and he fled with his family in 1974, working in Uruguay and Venezuela. With the return of democracy to Argentina in 1983, president Raúl Alfonsín appointed him as Secretary of State of Science and Technology (until 1989).One of his major contributions to computer science during this period, was the creation of the ESLAI (Latin American School of Higher Informatics).Sadosky was named an Illustrious Citizen of the City of Buenos Aires.[2]The Computer Science Department of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires is named after him.
