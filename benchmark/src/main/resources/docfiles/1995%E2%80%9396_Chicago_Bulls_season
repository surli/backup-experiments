In the 1995–96 season, the Chicago Bulls set the NBA record for wins, finishing the season 72–10.[1] The Bulls also became the only team to ever win 70 regular season games, easily finishing first overall in their division, conference, and the entire NBA. The team defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1996 NBA Finals, winning their fourth NBA title in six seasons.Prior to the 1995–96 NBA season, Dennis Rodman and Jack Haley were traded from the Spurs to the Bulls for Will Perdue and cash considerations to fill a large void at power forward left by Horace Grant, who left the Bulls prior to the 1994–95 NBA season.[2]Haley played in one game, the final game of the regular season and didn't participate in the playoffs. He was best known for his friendship with the enigmatic Rodman.[3]In his book Bad as I Wanna Be,[citation needed] Rodman stated that Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen had to approve the trade before it took place. Rodman chose the number 91 (9+1=10 according to Rodman for why he chose that number) for his jersey since #10 was retired by the Bulls in 1995 in honor of Bob Love.Source: Team Splits on Basketball ReferenceThe Bulls began the 1995–96 season on November 3 against the Charlotte Hornets and defeated them, 105–91, with Michael Jordan scoring 42 points.[4] The next day, Chicago defeated the Boston Celtics in a 22-point blowout.[5] On November 7, the Bulls defeated the Toronto Raptors behind Jordan's 38 points.[6] In Gund Arena, Chicago defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers on November 9, where Scottie Pippen accumulated a triple-double with 18 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists.[7] After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers on November 11, the Bulls reached a 5–0 start for the season.[8] On November 14, Chicago's undefeated streak ended with a loss to the Orlando Magic, despite a double-double performance by Pippen.[9] Following their first loss of the season, Chicago bounced back to defeat Cleveland on November 15.[10] The Bulls would continue their winning ways by defeating the New Jersey Nets on November 17.[11]From November 21–December 2, the Bulls would go on a road trip to play against Western Conference teams.
