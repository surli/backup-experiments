Fairholme Manor is a Designated Heritage building [1] located in the Rockland neighbourhood of Victoria, British Columbia. It was built in 1886 on Rockland Hill,[2] in a prestigious area known for its wealthy inhabitants, large lots and lush gardenscapes.[3]It was constructed for the sum of $7000 by contractors Hill and Conley and designed in an Italianate style by architect John Teague.[2] The home's rambling, two-story symmetry; overhanging eaves with decorative brackets; narrow bay windows; and low-pitched, gabled roof are all features typical of this fanciful late 19th century style.[4]Fairholme was built for John Chapman Davie, a prominent doctor and surgeon who is known today as an early promoter of Sir Joseph Lister's antiseptic surgical methods.[2] In addition to introducing the surgical practice to British Columbia, he was also largely responsible for the design of the first operating room at the Royal Jubilee Hospital.[5]Davie lived at Fairholme with his wife, Sara Holmes Todd, and his 3 children from a previous marriage. Sara Holmes Todd succumbed to pneumonia in 1894; Davie died in 1911.[2] The building was fully restored in 1996 and now operates as a bed and breakfast.[6]
