Secret Agent Man is a spy-fi television series that aired on UPN in 2000.The series, created by writer Richard Regen, starred Costas Mandylor as Monk, a gallivanting secret agent, who was one of a team of agents that included Holliday, played by Dina Meyer and Davis, played by Dondre Whitfield. The team reported to Brubeck, played by Paul Guilfoyle. The frequent guest villain is the former agent Prima, played by Musetta Vander.All the lead characters share the last names of jazz musicians Thelonious Monk, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, and Dave Brubeck.The series used an updated version of the 1960s Johnny Rivers hit, "Secret Agent Man", performed by Supreme Beings of Leisure, for its theme song. Because the original version of this song was also used as the theme song for American broadcasts of another television series, the 1960s British TV series, Danger Man (primarily broadcast in the U.S. as Secret Agent), there were some mistaken impressions that this series was somehow a spin off or remake of the earlier program, but other than the theme song, no connections were made evident.Only 12 episodes were broadcast before the series was cancelled due to poor ratings.
