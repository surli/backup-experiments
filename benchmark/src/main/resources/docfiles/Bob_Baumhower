Robert Glenn Baumhower (born August 4, 1955 in Portsmouth, Virginia) is a former American football player who played college football for the University of Alabama under Coach Paul "Bear" Bryant and professional football for the Miami Dolphins of the NFL under Coach Don Shula.[1]Playing as a defensive lineman, Baumhower was a two-time second team All-American in college and was selected five times to the Pro Bowl in the NFL. He was drafted by the Dolphins with the 40th overall pick in the 1977 NFL draft, just behind another defensive lineman from the Southeastern Conference, A.J. Duhe of LSU.Baumhower and Duhe, who eventually was moved to inside linebacker, formed the heart of the Dolphins' "Killer B's" defense of the late 1970s through mid-1980s, coached by defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger. Baumhower was flanked on the line by ends Doug Betters and Kim Bokamper, while other stars of the unit included outside linebacker Bob Brudzinski and defensive backs Lyle Blackwood and Glenn Blackwood. The unit was ranked first in the NFL in total defense in 1982, when Miami reached Super Bowl XVII.Years of taking on double- and triple-teams as a nose tackle began to take its toll on Baumhower's knees, and when he and Duhe began to miss chunks of playing time in the mid-1980s, the effectiveness of the Killer B's dropped dramatically. This was fully evident in Super Bowl XIX, when the San Francisco 49ers shredded the Dolphins for a then-Super Bowl record 537 yards in a 38-16 rout.Duhe was released prior to the 1985 season, Baumhower would retire after the 1986 season. Inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1995On December 14, 2008, Baumhower was inducted into The Miami Dolphin Honor Roll during a ceremony at Dolphin Stadium (now Sun Life Stadium).Baumhower is also the namesake for Aloha Hospitality, the company has a series of eight restaurants located in the state of Alabama specializing in buffalo wings.[2] He opened his first restaurant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in 1981, and expanded to Birmingham, Huntsville, Daphne, Mobile, Montgomery, Auburn, and Orange Beach.
