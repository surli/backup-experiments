* Senior club appearances and goals counted for the domestic league only.Brian Lewis (26 January 1943 – 14 December 1998) was an English footballer, most noted as a player for Portsmouth, Luton Town and Colchester United.Lewis started out with Crystal Palace, but after only three years as a professional he moved to the club he supported, Portsmouth. After four years with Portsmouth, he moved on to first Coventry City, in 1967, and then Luton Town, in 1968. In 1970 he signed for Oxford United, but within the year he was on the move again, joining Colchester United. While at Colchester he took part in one of the great FA Cup giant-killings, when Fourth Division Colchester took on Leeds United in the fifth round in 1970–71. Leeds were one of the best teams in the country, and the tie seemed decided before a ball was kicked – but Colchester's team of veterans managed to beat Leeds 3–2. In 1972 he returned to Portsmouth, where he finished his professional career in 1975, when he moved on to Hastings United.[1]
