Sdot Yam (Hebrew: שְׂדוֹת יָם, lit. Sea Fields) is a kibbutz in the Haifa District of Israel on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.It was founded in 1936 and moved to its present site at the southern border of the ancient city and archeological ruins of Caesarea, in 1940. The kibbutz falls under the jurisdiction of the Hof HaCarmel Regional Council. In 2013, the population was 711.[1]Sdot Yam was established in 1936, in the region, just south of Haifa, called the Krayot. It was founded at the urging of David Ben-Gurion during the period when the British were refusing to allow Jews to enter Palestine. It was ostensibly based on fishing, but was, in reality, a base for Palyam, for smuggling in then-illegal immigrants. Yossi Harel, famous for the SS Exodus and three other such ships, is buried at Sdot Yam.[citation needed]In 1940 the kibbutz was moved to its present location to the south of Caesarea.[citation needed] Its new residents were a gar'in from the Mahanot HaOlim youth group.The kibbutz originally based its economy on fishing, but today concentrates on land-based agriculture. It manages a banana plantation, avocado trees, and a herd of dairy cattle. The kibbutz's major source of income is Caesarstone Sdot-Yam Ltd., which engineers quartz surfaces under the Caesarstone brand name. In 2013, the kibbutz owned a 58 percent stake in the company, which makes stone counter tops for kitchens and bathrooms. Caesarstone is the largest company of its kind in the world.[2]The Hannah Szenes house is a study center founded in the name of Hungarian-born Hannah Szenes and the paratroopers who left Mandate Palestine for war-torn Europe in 1944 to save Hungarian Jews.
