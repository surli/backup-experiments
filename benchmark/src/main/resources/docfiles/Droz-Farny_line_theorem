In Euclidean geometry, the Droz-Farny line theorem is a property of two perpendicular lines through the orthocenter of an arbitrary triangle.Let  be a triangle with vertices , , and , and let  be its orthocenter (the common point of its three altitude lines. Let  and  be any two mutually perpendicular lines through . Let , , and  be the points where  intersects the side lines , , and , respectively. Similarly, let Let , , and  be the points where  intersects those side lines. The Droz-Farny line theorem says that the midpoints three segments , , and  are collinear.[1][2][3]The theorem was stated by Arnold Droz-Farny in 1899,[1] but it is not clear whether he had a proof.[4]A generalization of the Droz-Farny line theorem was proved in 1930 by Ren√© Goormaghtigh.[5]As above, let  be a triangle with vertices , , and . Let  be any point distinct from , , and , and  be any line through . Let , , and  be points on the side lines , , and , respectively, such that the lines , , and  are the images of the lines , , and , respectively, by reflection against the line . Goormaghtigh's theorem then says that the points , , and  are collinear.The Droz-Farny line theorem is a special case of this result, when  is the orthocenter of triangle .The theorem was further generalized by Dao Thanh Oai. The generalization as follows:Let P be a point on the plane, let three parallel segments AA', BB', CC' such that its midpoints and P are collinear. Then PA', PB', PC' meet BC, CA, AB respectively at three collinear points. [6]
