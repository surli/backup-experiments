The Schultz Nucleon is an American high-wing strut-braced, single-seat glider that was designed and constructed by Art Schultz.[1][2]The Nucleon was built by Schultz in 1954 and even though the wing was strut-braced the aircraft introduced some innovative construction techniques. The wing was carved from Styrofoam around its spar and then covered in fiberglass for a skin. The wing uses a NACA 65-415 airfoil, has full-span flaps and drooping ailerons, and is braced with a single faired strut. The strut-braced tailplane folds so that the aircraft can be loaded for ground transportation on a trailer.[1][2][3]Only one Nucleon was built and it is registered in the Experimental - amateur-built category.[1][2][4]The aircraft was flown in the 1956 US Nationals and completed several 200 mi (322 km) cross country flights.[2]In June 2011, 57 years after the aircraft was built, it was still on the US Federal Aviation Administration registry, listed as being subject to a sale.[4]Data from Sailplane Directory and Soaring[1][2]General characteristicsPerformance
