"The Boy Does Nothing" is a song performed by English singer-songwriter Alesha Dixon. It is the lead single from her second studio album, The Alesha Show. The song was written by Alesha along with the help of Brian Higgins, Miranda Cooper, Carla-Marie Williams, and other members of Xenomania.[1] The single was her first since 2006 after "Knockdown" was released in October of that year. It was also her first since signing with her new record label Asylum Records.The song, described as being "the stand-out track" on The Alesha Show,[2] received predominately good reviews and became a commercial success, charting within the top 10 on the majority charts it entered and entering the charts in over 20 different territories worldwide. The single was certified Gold in the United Kingdom and sold over 1,000,000 copies worldwide.[3][4] Dixon stated that despite the song's title, "The Boy Does Nothing", the song is "not a male-bashing kind of record,"[5] explaining that "the lyrical content is just cheeky more than anything".[5]Dixon had worked with Brian Higgins, of Xenomania, on her previous single, "Knockdown", but it failed to enter the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, resulting in Dixon being dropped by her record label, Polydor Records. In early 2007, still with no recording contract, Dixon received a phone call from Higgins, who asked if she would like to continue working together.[6] Dixon stated, "The plan was to make the whole record with Brian without talking to any record labels, we were just going to wait until we had made something special and then approach people with a finished album."[6] However Dixon's profile was raised when she signed up to compete in Strictly Come Dancing, which she eventually won. Soon afterwards, Dixon signed a deal with Asylum Records.[7] "The Boy Does Nothing", by this time already written, was originally intended to be a jazz orientated track, but Dixon and Higgins decided to change the genre, incorporating mambo influences, due to her experience on Strictly Come Dancing.[6] Dixon described the song as "a very tongue-in-cheek record"[5] and Higgins likened the song to "bottled happiness".[5]"The Boy Does Nothing" is a pop-mambo song with an up-tempo beat consisting of 88 beats per minute.[8] The original key is E♭ minor.[8] The instruments used were the bass guitar, drums, guitar and the keyboard.[9]The lyrics focus on the men in Dixon's past relationships and their lazy attitudes. The chorus states her frustration with men not completing everyday housekeeping tasks; "Does he wash up? Never wash up/Does he clean up? No he never cleans up/Does he brush up? He never brushed up". The in final verse the lyrics state, "And if the man can't dance/He gets no second chance"; a reference to her refusal to date men if they cannot dance. In an interview Dixon explained in further detail about the lyric, saying "I have to be honest, I do like a man who can dance, but it's not a deal-breaker. It's nice if they can dance, but if they can't we'll just have to work on other areas!"[10]Dixon performed her new single on the results show of Strictly Come Dancing on 19 October 2008, with the show's professional dancers, including her professional partner whilst on the show in 2007, Matthew Cutler.
