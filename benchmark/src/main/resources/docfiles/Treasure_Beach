Treasure Beach is the generic name given to four Jamaican coves and their associated settlements: Billy's Bay, Frenchman's Bay, Calabash Bay and Great Pedro Bay.[2]The region is isolated from the main tourist areas and the minor roads connecting with the main highway at Black River or Santa Cruz tend to suffer damage in heavy rain, but are usually passable with care.[3] There are a few small hotels and guest houses serving tourists seeking a very quiet seaside location.[2]Fort Charles Bay is the first Beach you get to from Black River. The beach is 11 miles long and a great swimming beach.Button Bay Beach Getaway is 1 mile from Fort Charles Bay. A great Bed and Breakfast property.Billy's Bay is 2 miles east of Fort Charles Bay and is the second fishing beach and settlement reached when approaching Treasure Beach from Black River.[1]Frenchman's Bay is the second beach and settlement reached when approaching Treasure Beach from Black River or Santa Cruz.[1][3]There are a number of small, bustling restaurants.[4]Calabash Bay is the first of the Treasure Beach settlements and beaches reached when approaching from Santa Cruz.[3]Its 600m long beach has a narrow strip of black and yellow-red sand. The swimming is good but since the beach is open to the south, small breakers sometimes appear when strong seas are running. The presence of tourists attracts a few hawkers to the beach to sell their wares.There are a few simple restaurants in the village.[2]One of the largest buildings is the former Old Wharf Hotel.[citation needed] It housed a residential treatment facility named Tranquility Bay,[5] which closed in January 2009. It is now used as a training facility of the Jamaica Constabulary Force.[citation needed]Great Pedro Bay is the most easterly of the settlements and beaches that make up Treasure Beach. The road ends here, regardless of where you are coming from.[1][3]
