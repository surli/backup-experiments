The Sir John Sulman Medal is a New South Wales architectural prize presented by the New South Wales chapter of the Australian Institute of Architects since 1932.[1]The medal is presented in memory of the Australian architect Sir John Sulman (29 August 1849 â€“ 18 August 1934).[1] Born in Greenwich, England, he emigrated to Sydney in 1885. From 1921 to 1924 he was chairman of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee and influenced the development of Canberra. The medal is sometimes referred to as the Sulman Award and now recognises excellence in public and commercial buildings. Before the advent of the Wilkinson Award it was on occasions presented to domestic projects.The Sir John Sulman Prize for "best subject/genre painting and/or mural project" is awarded by the Art Gallery of New South Wales and is not connected to the Sir John Sulman Medal, although named in honour of the same person.1936 - Railway House1937 - Frensham School1946 - Concord Repatriation General Hospital1959 - The Shine Dome of the Australian Academy of Science.1962 - Fisher Library, University of Sydney1967 - Australia Square1983 - MLC Centre1987 - Queen Victoria Building restoration1988- Powerhouse Museum1994 - Governor Phillip Tower1998 - Olympic Park railway station2002 - National Institute of Dramatic Art2003 - University of Technology Sydney2004 - Aurora Place2010 - North Ryde railway station2012 - Ravenswood School for Girls
