Original:1988-98, WAG-5A:1983-88 and105 km/h (65 mph)/Max:4,360 hp (3,250 kW)The WAG-5 is a type of electric locomotive used in India. It is the second most widely used locomotive in the Indian Railways, with a total of 1197 units built including variants.[1] WAG5A is the one with Alstom traction motors. WAG5B is a converted WAM4. WAG5H(x) is with Hitachi traction motors. WAG5P(x) is a passenger dedicated class. WAG5(x)D are fitted with dual brakes and WAG5(x)E are fitted with air brakes. WAG5RH and WAG-5HR are fitted with Rheostatic or Friction braking. Another variant is WAG-5HG.The units with additional '6P' markings have all parallel grouped traction motors. WAG-5HB is built by BHEL. Some units are fitted with Static Converter(STC), Microprocessor, Dynamic brake resistors(DBR) and SI unit. Due to the advent of WAG-7 and WAG-9, these locos except WAG-5HA/HB are even used for passenger trains although it is a freight-dedicated locomotive. WAG-5HB is homed at Jhansi shed near BHEL's installations for maintenance purposes. WAG-5 has a shell of WAM-4. Units numbered till 23293 have side Louvre and round glass windows like WAM-4 and units after 23293 have WAG-7 style of Louvre for better ventilation. Recently, WAG-5 have been fitted with data loggers. Unit numbered 23026 was selected by RDSO for adoption of thyristor controlled electricals in 1995. This was done due to the loss of suppliers of tap changer control. Project began in 1992. The new prototype system built in collaboration with Bhabha Atomic Research Centre was fitted in the locomotive between 1997-98. However due to several problems like interference with signalling equipment, the project was ceased in 1999. The engine was rebuilt to original WAG-5 and designated as WAG-5P.WAG-5HB has the following capacity for BOXN (in tonnes):WAG-5HB has the following capacity for BOX wagons (in tonnes):WAG-5HB has the following capacity for BCNA wagons (in tonnes):WAG-5HB has the following capacity for ICF coaches (in tonnes):WAG-5 with a gear ratio of 15:62 has the following capacity for BOX wagons (in tonnes):WAG-5 with a gear ratio of 17:77 has the following capacity for BOX wagons (in tonnes):WAG-5 with a gear ratio of 17:77 has the following capacity for BOXN wagons (in tonnes):
