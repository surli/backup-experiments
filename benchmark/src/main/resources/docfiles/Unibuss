Unibuss, formerly known as Nexus Trafikk and Sporveisbussene AS, is a Norwegian bus company group that operates from Oslo, Norway. It is a subsidiary of the municipal transportation group Sporveien, and was created in 2003 so the company could compete for the public service obligation (PSO) contracts that Oslo was to operate the bus system through. Unibuss has about 1600 employees, 650 buses and a revenue of NOK 1278 million in 2010.[1]Unibuss has two subsidiaries, namely the coach company Unibuss Tur (formerly known as Sporveisbussenes Turbiler and Unibuss Ekspress) and the express coach company Unibuss Ekspress. The latter operate airport buses between Oslo and Moss Airport Rygge (Rygge-Ekspressen), Oslo and Sandefjord Airport Torp (Torp-Ekspressen), and Trondheim and Trondheim Airport Værnes (Værnes-Ekspressen), in addition to express routes between Oslo and Trondheim, and Oslo and Kristiansand/Stavanger.The transfer of routes to Unibuss has been criticized among other things because the employees in Nexus Trafikk have worse pension conditions than in Sporveisbussene.[2] This was an inevitable move, as all bus transport in Oslo and Akershus is tendered and Unibuss had to adhere to the same tariffs as its competitors in order to be competitive.Most of the current contracts specify Euro V emission standards, with most of the buses adhering to the EEV standard. Two Volvo hybrid buses were added in 2010.Unibuss has won several of the contracts in Oslo, which are awarded by the Oslo Public Transport Administration, in addition to contracts with Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk in Akershus.[3]The company has since become subject to the new entity Ruter that covers both counties. Unibuss also operate buses in two areas of Vestfold.
