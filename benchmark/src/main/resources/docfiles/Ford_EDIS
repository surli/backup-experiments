The Ford EDIS or Electronic Distributorless Ignition System is a computer-controlled ignition system developed by Ford that uses an ignition coil for each pair of cylinders (wasted spark). All the coils are placed in a single module called a coilpack.Ford used the EDIS module on a number of vehicles from 1990 to 199X.The EDIS-4 module is used on the following vehicles equipped with the Ford HCS engine, and the 1.9-liter straight-4 Ford CVH engine, between 1990 and 1993:This system was also used on the 1995–2001 4-cylinder Ford Rangers and 1995–2001 Mazda B2300,B2500. But was incorporated into the EEC-V ECU, so there is no external module.The EDIS-6 module is used on the following vehicles equipped with the 4.0L Ford Cologne V6 engine and 3.8L Ford Essex V6 engine between 1990 and 1997:The European Ford Scorpio 2.9 V6 24V Cosworth also uses the EDIS-6 module.The EDIS-8 module is used on the following vehicles equipped with the 4.6-liter V-8 Ford Modular engine between 1990 and 1997:The EDIS-8 Module was also used in Some later 5.0L Ford Explorers until around 2002The EDIS system's relative simplicity, in particular the fact that it does not require a cam sensor, makes it a popular choice for custom car builders and classic car owners looking to retrofit a modern ignition system to their vehicle. The crankshaft-mounted trigger wheel, VR sensor, EDIS Module and an ignition control computer can all be easily fitted to most older engines that originally used a traditional distributor for ignition.
