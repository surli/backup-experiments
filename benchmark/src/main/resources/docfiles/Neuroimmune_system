The neuroimmune system mediates neuroinflammation and modulates neuronal activity, endocrine function and the CNS.[4] It can also be defined as a group of cells which mediate interactions between the nervous system and immune system. The neuroimmune system includes the mechanisms – e.g., receptors, ligands and reactive molecules, and intracellular proteins – within neuroimmune cells that are involved in signalling between the immune and nervous systems.[2][5]The key cellular components of the central nervous system (CNS) that interact with the immune system are glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes.[1][6][2]G protein-coupled receptors that are present in both CNS and immune cell types and which are responsible for a neuroimmune signaling process include:[5]The neuro-immune system, and study of, comprises an understanding of the immune and neurological systems and the cross-regulatory impacts of their functions.[7] Cytokines regulate immune responses, possibly through activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.[medical citation needed] There is growing evidence that auto-immune T-cells are involved in neurogenesis. Studies have shown that during times of adaptive immune system response, hyppocampal neurogenesis is increased, and conversely that auto-immune T-cells and microglia are important for neurogenesis (and so memory and learning) in healthy adults.[8]It has been demonstrated that prolonged psychological stress could be linked with increased risk of infection via viral respiratory infection. Studies, in animals, indicate that psychological stress raises glucocorticoid levels and eventually, an increase in susceptibility to streptococcal skin infections.[9]The neuroimmune system plays a role in Alzheimer's disease. In particular, microglia may be protective by promoting phagocytosis and removal of amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits, but also become dysfunctional as disease progresses, producing neurotoxins, ceasing to clear Aβ deposits, and producing cytokines that further promote Aβ deposition.[10] It has been shown that in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-β directly activates microglia and other monocytes to produce neurotoxins.[11]
