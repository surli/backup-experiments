Thomas Francis Qualters (born April 1, 1935), nicknamed Money Bags, is a former right-handed major league baseball pitcher, born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. He played with the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago White Sox in the 1950s.At six feet tall (183 cm), 190 lb. (86 kg), pitcher Tom Qualters was a bonus baby with the Philadelphia Phillies, signed out of high school for $40,000. He made his major league debut on September 13, 1953. He had an unusual rookie year, as he posted an ERA of 162.00. In his only appearance that year, he allowed six earned runs and retired just one batter. However, he remained on the Phillies' roster for two years, earning the nickname "Money Bags" from his teammates. After spending two years in the International League, he had a couple more cups of coffee with Philadelphia before being sent to the Chicago White Sox. He pitched respectably for the Sox in 1958, but an arm injury ended his career. His final game was September 25, 1958.In total, Qualters appeared in 34 games without a major-league decision. He holds the distinction of being the only pitcher to appear on a Topps baseball card four times without ever recording a win or loss.[1]After his baseball career ended, Qualters worked for the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as a law enforcement officer.[1]
