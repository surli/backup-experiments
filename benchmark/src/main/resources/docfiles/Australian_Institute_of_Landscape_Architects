The Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (AILA) is the Australian not-for-profit professional institute formed to serve the mutual interests of Australian landscape architects.The AILA was established in 1966 with an interim committee chaired by Richard Clough. The original subscribers were Malcolm Bunzli, Harry Howard, Bruce MacKenzie, Ray Margules, Professor Lindsay Pryor, David Steane, Jean Verschuer, Gavin Walkley, George Williams. (Ellis Stones was also a foundation member.) In 1967, this interim committee handed over to an elected Council with Peter Spooner as its first National President.Within Australia, the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (AILA) provides professional recognition for landscape architects. Once recognised, AILA landscape architects use the title ‘Registered Landscape Architect’.Across the eight states and territories within Australia, there is a mix of requirements for landscape architects to be ‘Registered’. Generally there is no clear legislative registration requirement in place. Any regulations or requirements are state based, not national.In Queensland as an example landscape architects do not need to be registered with this private organisation to practice.The AILA’s system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by AILA’s National Office in Canberra.Some agencies require AILA professional recognition or registration as part of the pre-requisite for contracts. Landscape architects within Australia find that some contracts and competitions require the AILA recognition or ‘registration’ as the basis of demonstrating a professional status.Registered and non AILA registered landscape Architects practise in the disciplines of landscape design & construct, landscape planning, landscape management, urban design, and those landscape architects employed as academics within universities.Professional recognition includes a commitment to continue professional development. AILA Registered Landscape Architects are required to report annually on their Continuing Professional Development.The AILA accredits landscape architecture programs at seven Australian universities:The AILA is a member association of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA).
