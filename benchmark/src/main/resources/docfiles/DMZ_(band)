DMZ was a first-wave American punk rock band from Boston, Massachusetts, strongly influenced by 1960s garage rock. In early 1976, Jeff Conolly (sometimes credited as J. Connally, Mono Mann, Monoman, Pokemonoman, etc.) stole the lead vocalist position in the nascent band by out-performing their singer at one of the band's practices.[1] Along with his vocals he brought two things the band lacked: keyboards (an electric piano) and original songs.Just over one year later, in April 1977, the band went into the recording studio with Craig Leon (who had produced the Ramones first album). Four songs from that session were released by Bomp! on a 7" vinyl EP. DMZ was signed by Sire Records and went to New York to record their debut album, produced by Flo & Eddie. One of the best known photographs of Bomp! founder Greg Shaw shows him holding this disc.[2]The EP was released in 1978 without much success and by the end of the year the group had splintered. Guitarists J. J. Rassler and Preston Wayne left to start the Odds,[3] and Conolly, bassist Rick Coraccio and drummer Paul Murphy formed Lyres.[4]DMZ has re-formed periodically; a 1993 set appears on the Live at the Rat album (along with 8 tracks from a 1976 show).Early drummer David Robinson (who had previously been in The Modern Lovers) left DMZ to join The Cars. Bassist Mike Lewis later joined the Lyres for a couple of years and later recorded with The A-Bones and Yo La Tengo.
