Garbh Bheinn is a steep mountain in the Ardgour area in the west of Scotland. It is much more prominent, in both a general and topographic sense, than many Munros, but because it is under 3000 feet and in a geographically isolated area, it is relatively infrequently climbed. Like other summits in the Ardgour area, it has been cited by those who deride the obsession with Munro bagging. From the summit, there are extensive views east to Ben Nevis and the mountains of Glen Coe, and west to several islands.There are several possible routes of ascent. All of them are steep and likely to require scrambling in places. Although most present no technical difficulties in good conditions, careful route finding may be required when descending from the main summit, especially in mist. Most approaches start at the old bridge at the foot of its south east ridge, where there is parking space. From there, the best route of ascent may be up the crest of the ridge, or via a path to the north of this ridge and then up to the saddle between the main summit and its south east top. There are no constructed paths up or onto the ridge, but the boots of successive climbers have created steps which show and facilitate the way in some places, but disappear or are creating erosion in others.Coordinates: 56°42′12″N 5°25′32″W﻿ / ﻿56.70343°N 5.42546°W﻿ / 56.70343; -5.42546
