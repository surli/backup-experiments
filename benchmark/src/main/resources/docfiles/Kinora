The Kinora was an early motion picture device, a form of mutoscope designed by Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re and manufactured in London by Kinora Limited between about 1895 and 1914.The Kinora worked very like a flip book or a Rolodex, using images which were conventional monochrome photographic prints fixed to strong, flexible cards attached to a circular core. As it was unable to project pictures, it could only be used by one or two people at a time, so was most suitable for home use. In the years before the First World War, the Kinora was the most popular medium for viewing home movies in Great Britain and Ireland.[1]The manufacturers, Kinora Ltd, developed the invention of the Lumieres. To begin with they supplied a range of moving picture reels produced from professional photographs, which could be bought or hired. Later, owners of a Kinora could have their own motion films produced by a professional photographer. Later still, beginning in 1908, the company supplied a special camera, accompanied by rolls of photographic paper or celluloid one inch wide, to enable people to make their own movies. These could be sent to the company for processing.[1]By 1914, when the company's London factory burned down, public interest in the Kinora had declined, at a time when the cinema screen held greater attractions. The company did not rebuild the lost factory.[1]
