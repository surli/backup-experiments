The Qasim Ali Khan Mosque (Urdu, Pashto: مسجد قاسم علی خان‎) is a 17th-century mosque in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The Qasim Ali Khan Mosque was built during Emperor Aurangzeb's reign (1658 to 1707), by Qasim Ali Khan, a news writer and administrator in the government of Kabul. The mosque is situated in the Misgaran Qissa Khwani Bazaar.Along with other mosques in the city, the Qasim Ali Khan Mosque has its own creation story deeply rooted in mythology. The legend surrounding the construction of the Qasim Ali Khan Mosque has been passed down through generations of citizens residing in Peshawar, creating a conflict amongst scholars and historians concerning the real identities of the builders of Qasim Ali Khan Mosque.[1] Another contender includes one of Emperor Akbar’s engineers, Qasim Ali Khan. He was the first to lay a road through the Khyber Pass and was later appointed the governor of Kabul and Peshawar.Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's residents invariably begin and end fasting according to an announcement made by the mosque's khateeb – currently Mufti Muhammad Shahabuddin Popalzai (6th Khateeb of the Popalzai family).
