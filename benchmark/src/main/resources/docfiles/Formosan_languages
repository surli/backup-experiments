The Formosan languages are the languages of the indigenous peoples of Taiwan. Taiwanese aborigines (those recognized by the government) currently comprise about 2% of the island's population.[1] However, far fewer can still speak their ancestral language, after centuries of language shift. Of the approximately 26 languages of the Taiwanese aborigines, at least ten are extinct, another four (perhaps five) are moribund,[2][3] and several others are to some degree endangered.The aboriginal languages of Taiwan have significance in historical linguistics, since in all likelihood Taiwan was the place of origin of the entire Austronesian language family. According to linguist Robert Blust, the Formosan languages form nine of the ten principal branches of the Austronesian language family,[4] while the one remaining principal branch contains nearly 1,200 Malayo-Polynesian languages found outside of Taiwan.[5] Although linguists disagree with some details of Blust's analysis, a broad consensus has coalesced around the conclusion that the Austronesian languages originated in Taiwan.[6] This theory has been strengthened by recent studies in human population genetics, supporting also the matrilineal nature of the migration.[7]All Formosan languages are slowly being replaced by the culturally dominant Standard Chinese. In recent decades the Republic of China government started an aboriginal reappreciation program that included the reintroduction of Formosan first language in Taiwanese schools. However, the results of this initiative have been disappointing.[8]In 2005, in order to preserve the language of the indigenous people of Taiwan, the council established a Romanized writing system for all Taiwan's aboriginal languages. The council has also helped with classes and language certification programs for members of the indigenous community and the Han Chinese to help the conservation movement.[9]There are various classifications of Formosan languages. These deny that the Formosan languages form a coherent language family apart from Austronesian.It is often difficult to decide where to draw the boundary between a language and a dialect, causing some minor disagreement among scholars regarding the inventory of Formosan languages. There is even more uncertainty regarding many extinct or assimilated Formosan tribes, since our knowledge of these is often sketchy at best. Frequently cited examples of Formosan languages are given below, but the list should not be considered exhaustive.Also in Taiwan, but not Formosan:Most Formosan languages display verb-initial syntax (VSO (verb-subject-object) or VOS (verb-object-subject)), with the exception of some Northern Formosan languages such as Thao, Saisiyat, and Pazih, possibly due to influence from Chinese.Li (1998) lists the word orders of several Formosan languages.[10]Tanan Rukai is the Formosan language with the largest number of phonemes with 23 consonants and 4 vowels containing length contrast, while Kanakanabu and Saaroa have the least number of phonemes with 13 consonants and 4 vowels (Blust 2009:165).The tables below list the Proto-Austronesian reflexes of individual languages given in John Wolff's Proto-Austronesian phonology with glossary (2010).[11]The following table lists reflexes of Proto-Austronesian *j in various Formosan languages (Blust 2009:572).The following table lists reflexes of Proto-Austronesian *Ê€ in various Formosan languages (Blust 2009:582).Lenition patterns include (Blust 2009:604-605):Li (2001) lists the geographical homelands for the following Formosan languages.[13]
