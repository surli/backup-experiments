In the Claws of Brightness (Filipino: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag), is a 1986 Tagalog language novel written by Filipino author Edgardo M. Reyes, originally serialized in Liwayway magazine from 1966 to 1967. The title In the Claws of Brightness is a word-for-word literal translation of the Tagalog title, which effectively makes little sense. A more practical English translation would be At the Verge of Dawn. The story became the basis for the award-winning Filipino film, The Claws of Light.[1]Julio, a poor fisherman, goes to Manila to search for his betrothed named Ligaya. Sometime before Julio's trip, Ligaya had left with a lady named Mrs. Cruz in order to study and work in the city. Now in Manila, Julio becomes a victim to some of the city's scums. Julio experiences abuses while working in a construction site. He eventually loses his job and desperately looks for a decent place where he can sleep. Slowly, Julio develops a cynical demeanor as he gradually loses hope of ever finding Ligaya.All this is put on hold, however, when Julio finally reunites Ligaya, and learns from her that she is a victim of white slavery. Julio and Ligaya plan to escape.[2]The 1975 adaptation entitled The Claws of Light that was based on Edgardo M. Reyes's novel was directed by award-winning director Lino Brocka. The script was written by Clodualdo del Mundo, Jr.[1]The book had been translated into Japanese by Motoe Terami-Wada. The novel, retitled as Manila: Hikaru Tsume (マニラ : 光る爪?) had become a bestselling book in Japan.[1]
