Bernstein–Kushnirenko theorem (also known as BKK theorem or Bernstein–Khovanskii–Kushnirenko theorem [1]), proven by David Bernstein [2] and Anatoli Kushnirenko [3] in 1975, is a theorem in algebra. It claims that the number of non-zero complex solutions of a system of Laurent polynomial equations f1 = 0, ..., fn = 0 is equal to the mixed volume of the Newton polytopes of f1, ..., fn, assuming that all non-zero coefficients of fn are generic. More precise statement is as follows:Let  be a finite subset of . Consider the subspace  of the Laurent polynomial algebra  consisting of Laurent polynomials whose exponents are in . That is: where  and for each  we have used the shorthand notation  to write the monomial .Now take  finite subsets  with the corresponding subspaces of Laurent polynomials . Consider a generic system of equations from these subspaces, that is:where each  is a generic element in the (finite dimensional vector space) .The Bernstein–Kushnirenko theorem states that the number of solutions  of such a system is equal to , where  denotes the Minkowski mixed volume and for each ,  is the convex hull of the finite set of points . Clearly  is a convex lattice polytope. It can be interpreted as the Newton polytope of a generic element of generic element of the subspace .In particular, if all the sets  are the same , then the number of solutions of a generic system of Laurent polynomials from  is equal to  where  is the convex hull of  and vol is the usual -dimensional Euclidean volume. Note that even though the volume of a lattice polytope is not necessarily an integer but it is an integer after multiplying by .Kushnirenko's name is also spelt Kouchnirenko. David Bernstein is a brother of Joseph Bernstein. Askold Khovanskii has found about 15 different proofs of this theorem. [4]
