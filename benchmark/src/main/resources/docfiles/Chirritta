A portion of the Maitland River runs through the property.The property was established by Donald Norman McLeod in the 1872[1][2] who returned to Victoria in 1882 and purchased Yannarie Estate near Portland and later returned to Western Australia acquiring Minilya Station.[1] In 1884 Chirritta was reportedly sold for £18,000.[3] By 1888 the property was put up for auction on behalf of D.N.
