Dnevni Avaz (Bosnian pronunciation: [dnêːʋniː ǎʋaːz]; English: Daily Voice) is a daily newspaper in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is published in Sarajevo.Dnevni Avaz evolved from a monthly publication Bošnjački Avaz which was first published in September 1993. In 1994 it became known simply as Avaz and was published weekly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Germany. In 1995 it was reestablished by Fahrudin Radončić as a daily newspaper.[1] It competes with Oslobođenje and SAN Daily News.Dnevni Avaz is part of the Avaz publishing house, the biggest news house in Bosnia and Herzegovina.[1][2] The paper is based in Sarajevo and has a pro-Bosniak stance.[1][3]As of 2006[update], the Avaz publishing house was expanded with the start of the construction of the Avaz Twist Tower a 172 m skyscraper in Sarajevo’s Marijin Dvor neighborhood, in the Municipality Center of Sarajevo. The company's former headquarters, the Avaz Business Center (Former Oslobođenje Building), has been converted into a hotel, Radon Plaza Hotel (based on the owner's last name Radončić). As of March 2015, the Avaz Twist Tower still doesn't have a Use permit, and suffers from extensive internal water damage. The ownership is not known. The only public transparent information was that Fahrudin Radončić is in process of selling the entire company to his ex-wife who cannot afford it. By making such a sale contract, he avoids being in conflict of interest (and staying in politics), while making sure he would regain ownership after the buyer (former spouse) fails to pay one of the agreed installments.Dnevni Avaz has published The New York Times International Weekly on Thursdays since 2009. This 8-page supplement features a selection of English language articles from The New York Times.
