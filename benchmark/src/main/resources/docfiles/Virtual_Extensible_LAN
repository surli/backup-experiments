Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) is a network virtualization technology that attempts to ameliorate the scalability problems associated with large cloud computing deployments. It uses a VLAN-like encapsulation technique to encapsulate MAC-based OSI layer 2 Ethernet frames within layer 4 UDP packets, using 4789 as the default IANA-assigned destination UDP port number.[1]VXLAN is an evolution of efforts to standardize on an overlay encapsulation protocol. It increases scalability up to 16 million logical networks and allows for layer 2 adjacency across IP networks. Multicast or unicast with HER (Head-End Replication)[2] is used to flood BUM (broadcast, unknown destination address, multicast) traffic.The VXLAN specification was originally created by VMware, Arista Networks and Cisco.[3][4] Other backers of the VXLAN technology include Broadcom, Citrix, Pica8, Cumulus Networks, Dell, Mellanox,[5]OpenBSD,[6]Red Hat[7] and Juniper Networks.The VXLAN was officially documented by the IETF in RFC 7348.Open vSwitch supports VXLAN overlay networks.
