Bishad Shindhu (Bengali: বিষাদ-সিন্ধু) is a poetic novel about the history of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's grand son Hasan, especially Husayn's assassination, and the war for the throne of Khalifa (the supreme power of Muslims). It was written by Mir Mosarraf Hussain, one of the first modern Muslim Bengali writers.Bishad Shindhu was written within 1888 to 1890. It is one of the best known works of Bengali literature. But it is not considered an authentic source for the history of Karbala, the location of Husayn's war front, and the place of his death.Bishad Shindhu is written in an epic style. It contains much poetic language, and many dramatic sessions. At the time, Bengali novels were rarely written, and a few writers (including Mosarraf Hussain) were trying to establish the concept of novels in Bengali. It was written in Shadhubhasha, a Sanskritised form of Bengali.Many Bengali Muslims view the novel as a religious book, and in rural areas, it is the most valuable book after the Quran and the Hadith which is a collection of sayings and actions of Muhammad.[citation needed]
