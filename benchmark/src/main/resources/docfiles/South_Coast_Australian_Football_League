The South Coast Australian Football League (SCAFL) is an Australian rules football competition in the Shoalhaven and Illawarra regions of New South Wales.The original South Coast AFL was formed in 1969, comprising Albatross, Creswell, Nowra and Wollongong. In 1970 the Bomaderry club was formed and in 1972 Dapto joined the competition.In 1975, Wollongong and Dapto left the league to create the Illawarra Australian Football League. They were joined by Bulli-Woonona (now known as Northern Districts), Port Kembla and Shellharbour, three clubs who had run junior programs but were introducing senior football. The sixth foundation club of the senior league was the University of Wollongong.The Illawarra league collapsed in 1988, with the Wollongong Lions moving to the Sydney Football League and the remaining clubs joining the South Coast AFL, which was renamed the Leisure Coast Australian Football League.The league returned to the name "South Coast AFL" in 2002.Two players from the South Coast AFL have played in the Australian Football League. Arthur Chilcott had a short career with the Sydney Swans between 1984 and 1985. He played 13 games and scored 14 goals. Aidan Riley was rookie listed by the Adelaide Crows via the NSW scholarship program, making his debut in 2011 in their round 19 match against Port Adelaide.
