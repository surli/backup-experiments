Larapinta Drive is a designated state route in the Northern Territory of Australia. It forms the primary road access to the community of Hermannsburg, as well as a number of tourist attractions located west of Alice Springs, including the Alice Springs Desert Park, West MacDonnell National Park, Kings Canyon, monuments dedicated to Aboriginal artist Albert Namatjira and Royal Flying Doctor Service founder John Flynn, as well as Albert Namatjira's house near Hermannsburg. [1]Larapinta is the local Arrernte name for the Finke River a major watercourse in the area.[2] The length of Larapinta Drive is marketed as part of the "Red Centre Way" tourist drive.[3]With the adoption of a state route numbering system of rural roads maintained by the Northern Territory Government in 1987, state route designations and signage were applied to Larapinta Drive. State route 2, from Alice Springs to Glen Helen follows Larapinta Drive as far as Namatjira Drive. From Namatjira Drive to Watarrka National Park, state route 6 signage applies.[4]Road conditions on the route are varied. Travelling west from the Stuart Highway the road is a divided dual carriageway for approximately 1 km (0.62 mi), crossing the Adelaide-Darwin Railway at grade and forming the boundary of the suburb of Gillen and industrial area of Ciccone. The road continues as a single carriageway beyond this point except for a short section of approximately 600 m (2,000 ft) in the suburb of Araluen. Beyond Alice Springs, Larapinta Drive is sealed as far as Hermannsburg. West of Hermannsburg, the road conditions are suitable to four-wheel drive vehicles as it is a dirt track and it is advisable to check road conditions before travel. This section is also known as the Mereenie Loop Road, and permits are required to enter traditional lands when travelling this route.[5] Australian Roads portal
