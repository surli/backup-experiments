I’ve been there for eight years, so from that point it is disappointing. But it is time for me to have a new challenge and go out and play somewhere every week".[29] During his five-year tenure at Palace, Hills made 47 appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring one goal.[21]In July 2012, Hills joined League One side Stevenage on trial, playing in the club's pre-season friendly draw with Boreham Wood.[30][31] After impressing during his trial period, Hills signed a three-year contract with the club, joining on a free transfer.[32][33] The first three months of Hills' Stevenage career were disrupted by injury, eventually making his first-team debut in a 4–1 away defeat to Sheffield United in November 2012.[34] Further injuries meant Hills appeared sporadically during the second half of the season, impressing in Stevenage's 4–0 victory over Sheffield United on 16 March 2013.[35] He made eleven appearances during the campaign.[36] Struggling to break into the first team, Stevenage and Hills mutually agreed to the termination of his contract, and he dropped down three divisions to join Whitehawk in the Conference South.[37][38]Hills has also represented England at U18 and U19 level.[32]He attended Christ Church School and Whitgift School in Croydon.[39]
