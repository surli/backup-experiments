Al McCoy (born April 26, 1933), sometimes nicknamed as The Voice of The Suns, has been the radio broadcast announcer of Phoenix Suns NBA basketball games since 1972[1] which makes him the longest tenured broadcaster in the NBA. In his entire tenure he has missed only one game due to illness (December 31, 2005 at the Chicago Bulls).McCoy is a resident of Arizona but a native of Williams, Iowa. He is a graduate of Drake University.Al McCoy's first job in radio was at KJFJ in Webster City, Iowa. He later worked for three years at WHO (AM) in Des Moines,[2] and he is still a frequent guest on "Two Guys Named Jim,"[1] a sports-talk show on WHO.Prior to joining the Suns on September 27, 1972 McCoy was the broadcaster for the Triple-A Phoenix Giants baseball club and "One of the Good Guys," a DJ on KRUX 1360 AM. McCoy was also the weekend television play-by-play man for the Arizona Diamondbacks during the club's first season in 1998. He worked with Joe Garagiola.His famous phrases include Shazam! every time a player makes a 3 point shot and Heartbreak Hotel! whenever a player misses a shot by little or the Suns lose a very close game. Other catch phrases include "Wham Bam Slam" or "Whammo" when a player slams the ball and "Zing go the strings" or "Swish-a-roo for two" (or just "swish-a-roo") when they swish a shot.He also has nicknames for individual players such as The Nash Rambler for Steve Nash, Captain Kidd for former Suns Captain Jason Kidd and the Matrix for now-former Sun and current Cleveland Cavaliers player Shawn Marion (although the origin of that nickname is generally attributed to former NBA player and TNT analyst Kenny Smith, not McCoy).In 2006 Phoenix Magazine named McCoy the best play-by-play announcer in their annual "Best of the Valley" issue.The Suns paid tribute to McCoy on March 2, 2007, distributing talking bobbleheads to fans at US Airways Center and renaming the Suns' press room the Al McCoy Media Center.McCoy received the 2007 Curt Gowdy Media Award during the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Family Reunion Dinner in Springfield, Massachusetts.Al is currently a member of the Broadcasters Hall of Fame
