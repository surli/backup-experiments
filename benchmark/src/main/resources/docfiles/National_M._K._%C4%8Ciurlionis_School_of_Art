National M. K. Čiurlionis School of Art was founded in 1945 in Vilnius, Lithuania. It is named after the famous Lithuanian painter and composer Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis since 1965.[1] It is the only such school in Lithuania, spanning the entire 12-year learning cycle. After the twelfth grade, having successfully passed final examinations in general and art subjects, pupils receive a school certificate. Learning is free of charge for Lithuanian pupils, but not for foreigners. Gifted children above 6–7 years old are allowed to join the school if their qualities match certain criteria of the correspondent specialty. The school also organizes training courses and seminars for students abroad.There are three main departments in the school: Music, Fine Arts and Ballet.

Young artists have had their works exhibited in Japan, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden, Finland and the USA.The Ballet Department offers courses in classical, character, duet and historical dance, artistry, ballet and theatre history, as well as other art subjects.
