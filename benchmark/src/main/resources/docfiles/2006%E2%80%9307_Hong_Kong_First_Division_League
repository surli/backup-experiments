The attendance was 8,426 and the matches were played in Mong Kok Stadium. It was the first time in 11 eleven years that Mong Kok Stadium is full for a First Division League match. (The full capacity of the stadium is 8,500. The unoccupied seats are due to unattended reserve tickets owners) It is also the first time since 1996 Senior Shield semi-final of Instant-Dict against South China where there is a full house in local Hong Kong football matches.[3] One possible reason for the high attendance is that the result of the South China-Kitchee match may decide the champion of the season. Either South China won or Kitchee won by 3–0 or more, the winner would be granted champion. However, the match ended 1–1, which means that the league champion would be decided after the last round matches.[4](round 4) (Happy Valley 0–3 Kitchee)[5]
