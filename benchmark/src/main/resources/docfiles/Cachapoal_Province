It is the fifth most populated province in the country. Between the 1992 and 2002 censuses, the population grew by 13.8% (65,871 persons).[1]As a province, Cachapoal is a second-level administrative division of Chile, governed by a provincial governor who is appointed by the president.The province comprises seventeen communes, each governed by a municipality consisting of an elected alcalde and municipal council.Located 85 km (53 mi) south of Santiago, Cachapoal Valley is a wine growing area in Cachapoal in the O`Higgins Region of central Chile, to the north of the Rapel Valley.[4] It is located between the heights of Paine to the north and Pelequén to the south, and between the Andes to the west and the smaller coastal range to the east. The valley takes its name from the Cachapoal River that flows through Rapel Valley along with its tributaries, the Claro and Cortaderal rivers. All these watercourses flow into Lake Rapel.The climate of the valley is temperate and consistently Mediterranean, sheltered by the coastal range from the cooling influences of the Pacific Ocean.Most of Cachapoal's noteworthy wineries and vineyards are located towards the east of the region, in the foothills of the Andes, away from the warmer valley floor. This is an area for Cabernet Sauvignon vines, while closer to the coast, where the ocean breezes flow through the coastal range, has more Carménère vines.
