Technopolis Oyj is a Finnish public company providing business incubator office space and services. Technopolis owns and operates 20 business parks located in the Nordic and Baltic region, often near universities or city centers. 47,000 people work and 1,700 companies operate in the business incubators. Originally from Oulu, Technopolis incubators are located also in Espoo, Helsinki, Vantaa, Jyväskylä, Kuopio, Lappeenranta and Tampere in Finland, and in Oslo, Norway, Vilnius, Lithuania, Tallinn, Estonia and St. Petersburg, Russia.[1] Thus, it has spread into most university cities in Finland.[2] Most the client companies are in the field of technology or services, although the company strategy is to expand to healthcare and education. To this end, Technopolis has built an ophthalmology center and a patient hotel in Tampere.[3]Originally a nonprofit, it has become a regular company.[4] It has been able to keep its utilization rate high because of the connection to services. It has also successfully been weaned off the Nokia dependency by renting space to universities and other public institutions, which agree to longer contracts than the Nokia-propelled startups.[5]Annual revenue was €126.3 million and profit €43.8 million in 2013. The two largest owners are Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company (23%) and Ilmarinen (10%). Technopolis shares are traded on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Of Finnish companies, most similar are Sponda Oyj, another listed company, which has a diverse portfolio of general office, retail and storage space, and Citycon Oyj (with Gazit-Globe as the largest owner), which operates shopping malls; neither provide incubator services.[5]
