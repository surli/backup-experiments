Between the two lines are two similar brownish lines from the inner margin nearer the base, waved before the apex. There is a very fine dark lunulate submarginal line from the apex, marked with black dots on the veins. The hindwings are crossed by straight lines. The basal area is pale and there are two dark antemedial lines enclosing a brown fascia with a line along its centre. There is also a pale fascia with a black cell-dot in it, edged by a brown line.
