Lenore Tawney (May 10, 1907 – September 24, 2007) was an American artist who became an influential figure in the development of fiber art.Born as Leonora Agnes Gallagher in Lorain, Ohio, Tawney's introduction to the tenets of the German Bauhaus school and the artistic avant-garde began in 1946 when she attended László Moholy-Nagy's Chicago Institute of Design. She studied with Moholy-Nagy, cubist sculptor Alexander Archipenko and abstract expressionist painter Emerson Woelffer, among others, and in 1949, she studied weaving with Marli Ehrman.In 1957, she moved to New York City, where she became associated with a generation of artists including Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Indiana, Agnes Martin and Jack Youngerman. Since then, Tawney lived and worked mainly in New York City, where she died, aged 100. “The first hundred years,” she said with a smile on her hundredth birthday, “were the hardest.”Widely known in the New York art world and beyond, she was the veteran of more than two dozen solo exhibitions in leading galleries and museums and she participated in dozens of important group exhibitions. Her work is in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art as well as many other museums, universities and private art collections.Lenore Tawney's work has been exhibited at the Renwick Gallery, The Smithsonian, Washington, D.C.; the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio; the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago; the American Craft Museum, New York City; the Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase, New York and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Netherlands, all of which have her works in their permanent collections.
