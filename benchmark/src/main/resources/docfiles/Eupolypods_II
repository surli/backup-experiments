L. Reveal in 1993.[2] However, the Blechnales families were found to be embedded within the larger definition of the order Polypodiales describe by Smith et al., 2006,[1] so according to their system, the group is treated as an informal clade.[3]This clade includes some important ferns, including the Sensitive fern, Onoclea sensibilis, which grows as a virtual weed throughout much of its temperate North American range, and ferns of the genus Thelypteris, a genus that has shown remarkable speciation. It also includes one of the more common horticultural ferns, the Ostrich fern, Matteuccia struthiopteris.The following diagram shows a likely phylogenic relationship between the families of eupolypods II, based on Lehtonen, 2011,[3] and Rothfels & al., 2012.[4]CystopteridaceaeRhachidosoraceaeDiplaziopsidaceaeAspleniaceaeHemidictyaceaeThelypteridaceaeWoodsiaceaeOnocleaceaeBlechnaceaeAthyriaceae
