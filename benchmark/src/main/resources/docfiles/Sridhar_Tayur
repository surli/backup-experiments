Sridhar R. Tayur is an American business professor, entrepreneur, and management thinker.[1][2] He is Ford Distinguished Research Chair and Professor of Operations Management at Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, the founder of SmartOps Corporation [3][4] and OrganJet Corporation,[5][6] and served as the CEO of SmartOps from 2000 to 2011. Tayur is known for his work in Inventory Theory,[7]Supply Chain Management, Lean Manufacturing, Operations Strategy,[8] and Healthcare Management. In 2012, Tayur was elected as a fellow of Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) in honor of his lifetime achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences.[9] Tayur's work "has earned him a reputation as someone uniquely talented in identifying, and then solving, novel and timely problems confronting society," according to a 2014 Productions and Operations Management article honoring him.[10]Tayur attended Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet, an elite school in the state of Andhra Pradesh. He earned his B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Madras in 1986, and Ph.D. in Operations Research and Industrial Engineering from Cornell in 1990. He joined Carnegie Mellon in 1991 as an Assistant Professor in The Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA) (today known as Tepper School of Business), received his tenure in 1996, and was promoted to Full Professor in 1998. He is currently Ford Distinguished Research Chair and Professor of Operations Management. Tayur is also Professor of Cardiology (by courtesy) at the Gerald McGinnis Center of West Penn Allegheny Health System.[11] He was President (2001-2002) of the MSOM Society,[12] the largest society of INFORMS, and serves or has served on the editorial board of (among others) Management Science, Operations Research, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, IIE Transactions, Optimization and Engineering, and Productions and Operations Management. He has also held visiting positions at Cornell University and MIT. Tayur founded SmartOps (in 2000) and OrganJet (in 2011), and has consulted various organizations, including Caterpillar,[4]ConAgra Foods,[13]Deere,[14] FlightOptions,[13]General Electric,[4]GlaxoSmithKline,[7]Intel,[4]Kellogg's,[13] and Microsoft.[15]Tayur's work covers — in collaboration with a wide range of researchers from several disciplines — various Operations Management fields, including Supply Chain Management, Lean Manufacturing, and Healthcare. His papers have been published in (among others) Operations Research, Management Science, Mathematics of Operations Research, Mathematical Programming, Queueing Systems, IIE Transactions, Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, and Production and Operations Management. Notable collaborators include other INFORMS Fellows such as Robin Roundy (his PhD thesis advisor), Jack Muckstadt, Paul Glasserman and Dimitris Bertsimas; faculty colleagues such as Alan Scheller-Wolf, R. Ravi, and Ravi Kannan; and PhD students such as Jay Swaminathan, Roman Kapuscinski and Pinar Keskinocak.Tayur is recognized for his Operations Research work in developing novel algorithms for models in stochastic inventory theory (using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis),[16]integer programming (using Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, Algebraic Geometry, and Gröbner Basis Theory)[17][18] and chance constrained programs (using random walks and rapidly mixing Markov-chain theory).[19]Tayur's "Value of Information in Capacitated Supply Chains,"[20] published in Management Science in 1999, is among "the twenty most cited 'supply chain' papers from 1995–2006,"[21] and among the top 30 most cited Management Science articles.[22] His co-edited book “Quantitative Models for Supply Chain Management” is among the most popular reference books on supply chain modeling,[23] and his work on "vanilla box" [24] and “models for supply chains in e-business”[25] are among the most popular references on supply chain management.At Allegheny General Hospital, Tayur has conducted clinical trials that have established the clinical benefits of genotype guided therapeutic dosing of warfarin therapy.[11] Tayur's work with Dr. Bennet Omalu, who discovered chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), applies OM methods to improve Medical Examiner's Office.[26] With transplant surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital, Tayur has analyzed liver allocation rules to better balance equity and efficiency between HCC patients and non-HCC patients.[27]Tayur's research has also analyzed new business models such as scheduling of fractional jets,[28][29] and dynamic scheduling of advertisements in video games.[15]His current work explores how to effectively combat the "dark side" of global supply chains such as child labor,[30] including understanding the potential impacts of a proposed national version of California's Supply Chain Transparency Act. His work also proposes effective countermeasures to strategic counterfeiters including those who are able to infiltrate licit supply chains.[31]Tayur was named one of the four “Masters of Supply-Chain Efficiency” by the Fortune Magazine,[32] and a “Most Popular Professor” by BusinessWeek.[33] He has been ranked as one of the stellar operations management researchers.[34] In 2012, Tayur was elected as a fellow of Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) for his “research on inventories and supply chain management, and developing new methodologies, implementing solutions in manufacturing, logistics and supply chains, and creating a market for enterprise inventory optimization software.” [35][note 1]Tayur's work on integer programming using Gröbner basis [18] was a finalist for the Frederick W. Lanchester Prize. In Healthcare Management, his co-authored paper "Imaging Room and Beyond: The Underlying Economics Behind Physicians’ Test-Ordering Behavior in Outpatient Services" was the First Place winner in Production and Operations Management Society (POMS) College of Healthcare Operations Management’s Best Paper Competition during POMS Annual Conference, Chicago, 2012.[36] His work with John Deere [37] — which reduced over $1B in Inventory in just four years [38] — was a finalist for the Edelman Prize. His PhD students have won a number of awards, including the George Nicholson Prize in 1996 and the George B. Dantzig Dissertation Award in 2011. He has won the undergraduate and MBA teaching awards, including George Leland Bach Excellence in Teaching Award. One of Tayur's teaching cases entitled “Managing Operations in the Time-Shared Jet Business" won the First Prize of INFORMS Teaching Case Award in 2000, and another, entitled "Patient Experience Improvement at UPMC Eye Center," won the Second Prize of the same award in 2012.Tayur has been a serial entrepreneur and an active promoter of monetizing Operations Research,[13] and was the first to coin the term “academic capitalist”.[39][40][note 2]He has also highlighted Academic Entrepreneurship in America.[41] He served on the advisory board of CCG Inc. (2001–10),[13] a private equity firm devoted to applying lean manufacturing techniques at small manufacturing firms and creating new jobs,[note 3] and is a member of the board of directors of Orchestra.[42] Tayur is also a charter member of TiE (The Indus Entrepreneurs).[43]In 2000, Tayur founded the software company SmartOps Corporation[44] (and won the First Prize in EnterPrize Case Competition that year[45]), and served as its CEO until 2012.Tayur has been recognized for his entrepreneurship of SmartOps Corporation by the Carnegie Science Center Award for Innovation in Information Technology,[46] and has been the subject of University of Virginia Darden School of Business's MBA Teaching case “SmartOps Corporation: Forging Smart Alliances?”[47]Through SmartOps, Tayur also coined the phrase "fix the mix."[48] Several SmartOps customers, including Cabot Corporation, Celestica,[49]ConAgra, Dow Chemical Company, Johnson & Johnson,[50]Kohler Company, Lubrizol, LSI Corporation, Medtronic, PPG Industries,[51]Wyeth, have spoken about their successes with Enterprise Inventory Optimization (EIO).On February 22, 2013, SAP AG announced that it will acquire SmartOps to "develop 'real-time supply chain' software solutions, leveraging the SAP HANA platform, which empowers customers to run their businesses in real time – to analyze, predict, react and adjust instantly."[52][53][54]In 2011, Tayur founded the social enterprise OrganJet Corporation that facilities multiple listing and provides on-demand private jet transportation solutions for patients to receive organ transplantation in a wider geographic range.[55][56]Since the founding of OrganJet, Tayur's "entrepreneurial approach to reform organ waiting list" has caught the attention of Nobel Laureate Alvin E. Roth, among other preeminent economists.[56][57] In addition, OrganJet has been covered by AOL/MAKERS initiative[58] and in media of regions suffering from geographic disparity in waiting times for organ transplants such as Boston,[59] Denver,[60] and Wisconsin.[61]On August 7, 2013, it was announced that Irena Bucci, a resident of Washington D.C. area, through the service provided by OrganJet, successfully received a kidney transplant in Pittsburgh.[62]On August 20, 2013, OrganJet released a free self-service App to help chronic kidney disease patients find a low wait kidney transplant center in the US.[63]In June 2014, OrganJet sponsored a “Transplants” campaign with Mediaplanet and USA Today aiming to increase the public's awareness of the importance of organ donation.[64]A 2014 The Atlantic article titled "A Private Jet Is Waiting to Take You to Your Kidney Transplant" detailed the motivation behind Tayur's founding OrganJet and the company's latest developments.[1] In 2015, Tayur and OrganJet were profiled in Forbes.[65][66][67] In discussing geographic inequality in organ transplantation, a 2014 The New England Journal of Medicine article cites OrganJet as an example of mobilizing the recipients (instead of mobilizing the organs) that would face lesser "political resistance that has stood in the way of broader organ sharing to date."[68] The American Journal of Transplantation, in its February 2015 issue of "The AJT Report," mentions Tayur and his work through OrganJet as one of "grassroots groups and organizations formed to improve the quality of life for transplant candidates, recipients, their families, and the families of organ and tissue donors."[69]In line with Herbert A. Simon's reflection that “executive centrifuges” are needed for a science of “judgment mechanics,”[70] Tayur proposed the term "management mechanics,"[71] which is a methodical way to conduct quantitative-model-based "management consulting" that also allows for a systematic way to implement organizational change that is sustainable using enterprise information technology. A wide range of "what if" analysis allows senior executives to tackle practical problems in operations management (PPOM) in the spirit of Peter Drucker's views on Management Science.[72]PPOMs in product companies (across a variety of industries) include designing rapid response supply chains,[73] optimizing product portfolios,[74] implementing a postponement strategy,[75] planning production with significant changeover times and costs,[76] reducing net landed cost in procurement,[77] optimize working capital needs to meet service levels,[37] operate a global supply chain using S&OP process,[78] quoting accurate lead times,[79] and design a seasonal logistics strategy.[80] Management Mechanics helps executives make sound judgements on strategic decisions that may span multiple organizational silos in their firm, or even cross firm boundaries.“Contract Hybrids,” as a new legal entity, was proposed by Bromberger [81] as a method to obtain the best of “for-profit” and “not-for-profit” entities, and further explored by Battilana et al.[82] In July 2012, OrganJet (for profit) and GuardianWings (not for profit) became the first social enterprise to have a “contract hybrid” where a for-profit entity is symbiotically integrated with a not-for-profit subsidiary sharing a common social mission of providing inclusive access to organ transplantation. [83][84]A 2013 Harvard Business School case entitled "OrganJet and GuardianWings" (by Julie Battilana and James Weber) covers the decision process behind the organizational structure of OrganJet and GuardianWings.[5] The case has been used by University of Michigan Ross School of Business, among other business schools, in its course "The Corporation in Society," where Tayur was interviewed by the instructor Jim Walsh,[85] and students were asked to write on "If you were Sridhar Tayur, how do you think about your aspirations to establish OrganJet and GuardianWings, change the current transplant system in America, honor your commitments to Carnegie-Mellon University, and live a full life?" [86]In an interview with The Guardian, Tayur said that the hybrid model was more efficient than a traditional pure for-profit or not-for-profit: "It would have been much easier for me to have said it's a not-for-profit or a for-profit and satisfy the skeptics. But the primary goal of my company is to help as many people as possible get transplants quicker."[87]Through SmartOps, Tayur has also explored massively parallel versions of enterprise inventory optimization (EIO) algorithms on IBM's Blue Gene. In 2005, as Blue Gene's first supply chain application,[88] the IBM-SmartOps pilot solved industrial scale problems with over a million variables in 0.04 seconds on a "half rack" system with 512 processors.[89]Tayur was a plenary speaker for 2007 INFORMS Conference,[90] 2008 MSOM Conference,[39] and 2015 POMS Annual Meeting.[40][91] He served as the commencement speaker for South Park High School in 2008, and Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University in 2009.[92] Tayur was invited to speak at various major forums, including UCLA's Marschak Colloquium, and Harvard's Igniting Innovation Summit,[93] both in 2012. His 2013 speech at Brigham Young University was entitled "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Certain Mathematical Models in Practice,"[94][95] resembling Eugene Wigner's The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences. In his supply chain thought leader plenary at MSOM 2014, he discussed "Management Mechanics" in his talk "Virtuous Cycle: From Problem Identification to On-going Value Creation."[96] In 2014, Tayur delivered a Bangs Lecture titled "OR/OM Entrepreneurship in the 21st Century" at Cornell University.[97][98]Tayur has also been a guest speaker for undergraduate, MBA and MS courses at several universities including Harvard Business School, Cornell University (Engineering), MIT (both Sloan and Engineering Schools), University of Virginia Darden School of Business, and Ross School of Business, University of Michigan. He was a speaker for TiE StartupCon.[43] In addition to his speeches on research, entrepreneurship and applications, he has spoken and written about the importance and strategy of preparing business faculty for effective MBA teaching.[99] Tayur has also participated in panels that discuss life and career success factors (including, but not limited to immigrants and/or minorities) such as at WGBH event celebrating Asian Heritage.[100]Tayur was born in Madras (now Chennai) in India to a Kannada-speaking family. His father was in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). Tayur is married to Gunjan Kedia, and they have two children, both boys. Tayur and Kedia supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential election.[101]In April 2014, Carnegie Mellon University received a $1 Million gift from Tayur and his wife Gunjan Kedia,[102] a Tepper alumna (MSIA ’94). This gift is intended for constructing the Tepper Quadrangle that will house the new Tepper School of Business building.[103]Tayur's charitable foundation, RAGS Family Foundation, has supported documentaries, such as Journey to Normal[104] that was featured by The Shriver Report,[105] and profiles several women veterans including Christine Mau who became the first woman to fly an F-35 Fighter Jet after her return.[106] The foundation also supports Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival, one of the largest Asian film festivals in the U.S., including providing the funding for the annual People's Choice Award.[107][108][109][110][111] Through SmartOps in 2010 and RAGS Foundation in 2013, Tayur has supported "The American Revolution," a feature-length documentary film.[112][113] He is also a member of the Leadership Donor Group at the Brattle Film Foundation.Tayur has served as a policy advisor to the Polaris Project to counter human trafficking.[114] He has also supported Massachusetts General Hospital's organ transplantation research through sponsoring its "2015 Transplant Golf Classic" event.[115]Through SmartOps, he sponsored the MIT Sloan Annual Operations Simulation Competition (OpsSimCom) in 2010 and 2011,[116] and Els for Autism 2011 Golf Challenge.[117]
