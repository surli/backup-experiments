Solid Gold Pet is a manufacturer and a world-wide supplier of natural, holistic pet foods based in Greenville, South Carolina. They also maintain distribution centers in Leipzig, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore, Atsugi, Japan, and Espoo, Finland.The founder of Solid Gold, Sissy Harrington-McGill, raised great danes. In the early 1970s she traveled to Germany to acquire championship bloodline dogs, and while there learned that great danes bred and kept in that country were living significantly longer than those being bred and kept in the United States. She surmised that the reason for their longevity was the German practice of using more naturalistic dog foods. Upon returning home, she immediately began to research dog food nutrition. She decided her dogs deserved a nutritious, natural food that would keep them happy and healthy. In 1974, Sissy developed her first formula out of natural ingredients, named Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken and began marketing it. She believed everyoneâ€™s pets deserved the best and built a strong following of pets and their owners, sample by sample.Now, over 40 years later, Solid Gold specializes in the development of dry and wet dog and cat foods which contain no preservatives or saturated fats, and are made of USDA Choice meats such as bison, lamb and chicken, and grains like whole grain brown rice, barley, oats and millet, instead of wheat, soy, or corn like most other manufacturers. The company also has dog treats and supplements for both cats and dogs.
