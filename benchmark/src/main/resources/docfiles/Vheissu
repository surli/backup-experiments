Vheissu (pronounced "vee-sue"[6]) is the fourth studio album by Thrice. It was released on October 17, 2005 by Island Records and peaked at #15 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album was released in two separate versions, including a limited edition version containing a booklet detailing the creation process of each track.The album is characterized by many critics as being a rather experimental deviation from Thrice's post-hardcore roots, with the implementation of elements such as piano melodies ("For Miles"), electronica ("Red Sky"), folk Japanese music-box undertones ("Music Box" - The melody comes from the song Sakura Sakura) and chain gang chant choruses ("The Earth Will Shake"). UK producer Steve Osborne, whose past credits include many Brit-pop hits, was sought by Thrice to gain a new perspective on the songwriting process, enabling the band to expand their musical influences and produce a different album.According to an interview with drummer Riley Breckenridge, the group recorded the album at Bearsville Studios, the same place he recorded drum tracks for 2003's Artist in the Ambulance. In describing reasons for returning to Bearsville, Breckenridge said, "It's so secluded and so cut off from everything ... and it was really cool to kinda separate ourselves from the rigors of being at home and the distractions of friends and families, and traffic and the L.A. and Orange County lifestyle."[7]The album artwork was created by author Dave Eggers and artist Brian McMullen.[8] Eggers has said that he had not done freelance design in years, but after meeting the band and reading the lyrics he was happy to be involved in the project.Prior to the album release date, a four-part series of podcasts discussing the making of the album was released by the band, giving previews of each track and how it was recorded.The morse code at the beginning of "Image of the Invisible" spells out the album's title.The first track on Vheissu "Image of the Invisible" was featured on the soundtrack for Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.
