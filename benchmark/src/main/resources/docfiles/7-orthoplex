In geometry, a 7-orthoplex, or 7-cross polytope, is a regular 7-polytope with 14 vertices, 84 edges, 280 triangle faces, 560 tetrahedron cells, 672 5-cells 4-faces, 448 5-faces, and 128 6-faces.It has two constructed forms, the first being regular with Schläfli symbol {35,4}, and the second with alternately labeled (checkerboarded) facets, with Schläfli symbol {3,3,3,3,31,1} or Coxeter symbol 411.It is a part of an infinite family of polytopes, called cross-polytopes or orthoplexes. The dual polytope is the 7-hypercube, or hepteract.There are two Coxeter groups associated with the 7-orthoplex, one regular, dual of the hepteract with the C7 or [4,3,3,3,3,3] symmetry group, and a half symmetry with two copies of 6-simplex facets, alternating, with the D7 or [34,1,1] symmetry group. A lowest symmetry construction is based on a dual of a 7-orthotope, called a 7-fusil.Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a 7-orthoplex, centered at the origin areEvery vertex pair is connected by an edge, except opposites.
