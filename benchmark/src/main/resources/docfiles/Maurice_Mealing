Then, in March, while Mealing was on the brink of acedom, the German build up toward their last offensive supplied him with numerous opportunities. Between 8 and 24 March, he accumulated ten more wins, including another balloon busted, a reconnaissance aircraft shared with Captain William Spurrett Fielding-Johnson and another two-seater downed while teamed with Second Lieutenant Harold Walkerdine, Lieutenant Henry John Burden, and three other British pilots.[1][2] On 24 March, he was seen pursuing a pair of German two-seaters; another report had him standing waving next to his grounded aircraft.
