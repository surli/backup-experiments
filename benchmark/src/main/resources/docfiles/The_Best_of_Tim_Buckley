The Best of Tim Buckley is a compilation LP by Tim Buckley. It presents Buckley as a folk artist with all of the songs having been written between 1966 and 1970. The album features material from the studio albums Tim Buckley, Goodbye and Hello, Happy Sad and Blue Afternoon, in addition to "Song to the Siren" from his avant garde album Starsailor. This was the first new release, outside of Australia after Buckley's death. The album provides an overview of Buckley's folk beginnings, excluding material from his later albums.On October 2, 2006, the album was re-released, recompiled and remastered for a new retrospective. The new release featured a greater breadth of material from Buckley's career, including tracks from all of Buckley's studio albums. Reviews have been mixed, largely due to the problem of trying to give a retrospective of the artist while at the same time trying to include his most critically praised works.[1]Original Track Listing
