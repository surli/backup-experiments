"Calling America" is a song by the rock music group Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) released as a single from their 1986 (see 1986 in music) album Balance of Power. The single reached number 28 in the UK and peaked at number 18 on the Billboard singles chart, making it their final hit single in the United States.It became the band's first hit in three years. The song is, like most of the songs on Balance of Power, musically upbeat and bright but lyrically darker, concerning a dishonest lover (e.g., part of the lyrics state, "said she'd call when she'd been gone awhile," with an echo in the background stating "liar, liar, liar, liar, liar"). This was similar to other Jeff Lynne songs with ELO that were musically upbeat with lamenting words about broken love (e.g., Turn to Stone, Don't Bring me Down, Yours Truly 2095).There was also a UK 12Â inch EPIC 3 Track version with "Destination Unknown" on the B-Side.All songs written by Jeff Lynne.The video was shot in Paris and contains shots of Centre Georges Pompidou; the band plays in front of Pompidou.
