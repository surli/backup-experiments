Chelsea railway/tube station is a proposed station on Crossrail 2 and the Chelsea-Hackney line (also known as the "Chelney line" and the "Hacksea line"). Alternative names for the station are Chelsea Kings Road, Chelsea Riverside, Kings Road (Chelsea) or simply Kings Road.The line is currently considered the fourth major rail project in the capital after the Thameslink Programme, East London Line extension and Crossrail 1. It is not likely to open until 2022 at the earliest.[1]In the current plans Chelsea station will be part of a tunnelled section between Parsons Green and Sloane Square, although the exact location would only be fixed when the line is finally approved.According to the June 2008 safeguarding directions, the surface structures of interest lie either side of Dovehouse Street (including Dovehouse Green) at its junction with Kings Road and some small buildings on the south side of the road opposite.[2][dead link]Following the 2013 public consultation, revised plans were published in June 2014 by the Mayor of London which indicate two possible alignments for the railway tunnels along with two potential sites for a station in Chelsea:[3]The location is under continual debate and eventually may be influenced by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London Mayor and residents and local businesses on Kings Road. In the 2013 survey 20% of residents opposed or strongly opposed a site on Dovehouse Green. Further options for a location to build Chelsea tube station include:[citation needed]South of the proposed station at Dovehouse Green the route would pass under the Thames close to Battersea bridge and thence to Clapham Junction. There was discussion to add a Battersea Village stop (on the west side of Battersea Park, to complement Battersea Nine Elms (Northern line extension to Battersea) on the eastern side of Battersea Park); cost may deter an additional station.[citation needed]A tube line from Chelsea to Hackney was first proposed at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1904 a bill was put before Parliament, but was defeated by the political allies of rival tube constructor Charles Yerkes. It was proposed again in the late 1960s and has been on the long-term agenda since then. An integral part of the plan was to build a new station in the centre of Chelsea along the Kings Road, which is not currently served directly by any tube or national rail station.It was safeguarded as part of a potential route in 1991 and 2007.[4]Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council are strong supporters of Chelsea station, as well as returning Sloane Square into the project after it was dropped from the route.[5]
