The Kinesaki class food supply ship (杵埼型給糧艦, Kinesaki-gata kyūryōkan?) was a class of four reefer ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), serving during and after World War II. Eleven vessels were planned under the Maru 4 Programme, Maru Rin Programme (Ship #261–263) and Kai-Maru 5 Programme (Ship #5401–5407), however, only four vessels were completed.In 1939, the IJN planned two food supply ships for China Area Fleet under the Maru 4 Programme. One was the 600 ton type Nosaki (initial named Support ship No. 4007), the other the 1,000 ton type Kinesaki (initial named Support ship No. 4006). The Navy then ordered several more ships to the design of the Kinesaki; these became the Hayasaki, Shirasaki and Arasaki. The Navy intended to order several more ships of this design by 1942, but Japan's worsening situation in the war by this stage led to the abandonment of these plans.The Kinesaki served in the Central Pacific Area, the Hayasaki in the Southwest Area, the Shirasaki in the Northeast Area, and the Arasaki in the Southeast Area. They also undertook convoy escort operations. The Kinesaki was sunk on March 1945, while the other ships of the class survived the war.Arasaki in May 1943 at Osaka Bay.
