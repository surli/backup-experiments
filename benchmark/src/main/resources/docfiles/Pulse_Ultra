Pulse Ultra was a four-piece rock band from Montreal, Quebec.Pulse Ultra was initially formed as Head Space in 1997 by guitarist Dominic Cifarelli and bassist Jeff Feldman. Drummer Maxx Zinno was added that same year, followed by vocalist Zo Vizza two years later.Pulse Ultra's break came in 2000 when the band met Taproot, with Cifarelli later passing on one of their demos to the band. Taproot guitarist Mike DeWolf, through their management team Velvet Hammer, later got the band signed with Atlantic Records.After a year of songwriting, the band issued their debut album Headspace on July 16, 2002. The band would appear on the Ozzfest tour that year in support of the album's release. Subsequently, the album failed to push the band into the mainstream. In early 2004 the band went back to L.A. to work on the follow-up to "Headspace". A few months into pre-production, Atlantic Records merged with AOL/TIME/WARNER. This resulted in Pulse Ultra being dropped due to minimal record sales.At some point during mid-2004, tensions grew between the band and Zo. Which soon after would lead Pulse Ultra to look for a new vocalist. In a post on the band's official forum, Zo stated that the split was amicable and they were all on good terms. Despite auditioning Lukas Rossi, the band would disband shortly after. They are now all involved in other projects. Dominic Cifarelli (guitarist) released his debut solo project The Chronicles of Israfel in 2007 and this project is on hiatus as he now plays bass in Scars on Broadway. Jeff Feldman is now playing bass in electronic/avant-garde band Elsiane and is working on other numerous endeavours which include soundtrack music and a project titled Hallway Memoirs. Maxx Zinno later played drums for the Los Angeles based indie rock trio RunTheir single "Build Your Cages" was featured on the soundtrack for Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2, released by EA in 2002.
