Tetsuya Hibino (日比野哲也, Hibino Tetsuya?, John Motorfix) 10 April 1974, Aichi is a Japanese professional drifting driver, currently competing in the D1 Grand Prix series for SunRise and Aion.Like many of the drivers in the D1GP he is the owner of his own tuning shop called SunRise, and works on his car himself. He is quite a popular driver as he is one of best drivers of the Toyota AE86 chassis in the D1GP today, he is also famous for his jumping drift which he first showed at Ebisu Circuit in 2004, where he drifts while his car is airborne. He has always driven the Toyota Corolla Levin since he began and the combination of its light weight and his aggressive driving style make him a formidable opponent. His Levin is heavily modified, featuring the SR20 engine from a Nissan Silvia which gives a significant performance advantage over the standard engine. Though some of the more hardcore AE86 fans do not like this Nissan transplant, it is fairly common. He now drives the new Toyota GT86 powered by an EJ20 engine from Subaru (boxer engine).He Began competing in the D1 Grand Prix in the sixth round in 2002, though he did not get any recognition until round 3 of 2004 when out of nowhere he defeated many well known names to take second place, and first exhibited his jumping drift which took the crowd and judges by storm. Although he has never actually won a round yet he has come second on a few occasions proving he has got what it takes, and just needs to be patient.(key)
