"Ride" is a song by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey from her third EP, Paradise (2012). The song was written by Lana Del Rey and Justin Parker, while produced by Rick Rubin, the song served as the reissue's first single on September 25, 2012 through Interscope Records. "Ride" is a pop ballad that thematically involves parental problems, alcohol consumption, and loneliness. The cover for the song depicts Del Rey on a tire swing, wearing cowboy boots and a denim jacket."Ride" received positive reviews from music critics, who compared Del Rey's vocals with that of Adele and Brandon Flowers of The Killers. While only a modest hit in the United States, Switzerland, Ireland, and France, the song reached the top 10 in Russia and Belgium. The accompanying music video for "Ride" was directed by Anthony Mandler, and was released on October 12, 2012. Del Rey's role in the video was compared to Lolita and A Streetcar Named Desire. The monologue treatment at the prologue and epilogue of the video met polarized opinion; some considered it "meaningless" and a "jibe to her critics", while others called it "moving" and "really something"."Ride" is a ballad, composed in the soul pop genre. In the song, Del Rey sings over a string-drenched, piano-driven melody produced by Rick Rubin.[1] Lyrically, the song was written by Del Rey and Justin Parker, who co-wrote almost every song on Del Rey's debut album, Born to Die. In the song, Del Rey sings lines such as, "I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy" and "Been trying' hard not to get into trouble/But I, I've got a war in my mind... so I just ride".[2][3] The song opens with an audible inhalation, before Del Rey gushes out, "I've been out on that open road". The recording features mild cursing, but is otherwise laced with nostalgic lyrics and husky vocals.[4] To further solicit the single and album, an EP was released containing remixes of "Ride". Contributing artists include SOHN, MJ Cole, Eli Escobar, 14TH remix, Wes James, and James Lavelle.[5] Two additional remixes of the song (the Penguin Prison and the Lindstrom remixes) were released as bonus tracks with the exclusive Target release.[6][7]"Ride" earned critical commendation from music critics. Contactmusic.com noticed the track adheres to Del Rey's trademark sound, stating that the notion of her even having a trademark after one commercially successful album indicates that "we haven't seen the last of her just yet." Of the production itself, it was said that "Ride" is more accomplished than Del Rey's previous endeavors, with the strengths of the track outshining the flaws. The reviewer concluded by saying, "All that doe-eyed “you can be my full-time daddy / baby” shtick is going to start getting a little tired pretty soon, though, we reckon."[8]NME blogged that the song's most significant lyric read, "I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy", while stating that the accompanying music video may be produced solely by Del Rey, as the videos for "Carmen" and "Video Games" were.[2] In a separate review for the same publication, Eve Barlow was critical of the song, writing that Del Rey sounded like "an oversexed frog being dragged against a washboard."[9]Pitchfork Media opined aforementioned lyric was a rare moment of raw emotion by Del Rey.[10]Billboard wrote: "Ride' is a long, dreamy ballad that swells into full view during the chorus, when the singer declares, 'Been trying' hard not to get into trouble/But I, I've got a war in my mind… so I just ride."[3]MTV called "Ride" a "slow burn" and "as mellow and languorous...as on her debut."[11] Another MTV review said: "On 'Ride,' Rey sings what she knows best: loneliness, some daddy issues and day-drinking. All of this is probably a metaphor for something, but honestly, we’re still trying to figure out what those 'Born To Die' tigers mean."[12] A third review by MTV dubbed the single the number one "Must Hear" song of the week, saying, "Heaven is truly a place on Earth with you, Miss Lana."[13] Similarities were drawn between "Ride" and work by The Killers frontman, Brandon Flowers, on his solo debut, Flamingo.[13]Stuff said the title "Ride" was predictably pokerfaced.[14] Cameron Matthew of Spinner noted that Del Rey "amped up on the smokey vocals" with "Ride."[15]Tom Breihan of Stereogum said "Ride": "moves [Del Rey] back to the power of "Video Games" and "Blue Jeans" while simultaneously pushing her into a grand Adele crossover-soul-pop zone. It's really nice. There's hope for this lady yet!"[1] Amanda Dobbins wrote on New York magazine's professional music blog, Vulture, that Del Rey is "still calling men who are not her father 'Daddy," on "Ride."[16]Dose reviewer Leah Collins called the record "predictably morose".[17]Complex named "Ride" the eighth best song of 2012.[18]On October 10, Del Rey premiered the music video for "Ride" at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California.[22] "National Anthem" director Anthony Mandler teamed up with Del Rey to produce the video for "Ride."[23][24] The video was a 10-minute-long short film and gathered an audience of 400.[24] Opening with an image of Del Rey swinging on a suspended tire (as depicted on the single cover), Del Rey narrates: "I was in the winter of my life—and the men I met along the road were my only summer."[23] Further into the narration, Del Rey expresses how she found sanctuary through traveling, while on tour, because the singer had not had a proper home for a long time.[23] She also expressed that her dreams of becoming a poet were crushed and eventually opened the doors necessary to begin a career as a singer.[23] Following the confession, Del Rey is seen riding on a motorcycle, flanked by a clique of leather-clad bikers and wearing a novelty t-shirt that reads, "Buttwiser: King of Rears."[24] Other scenes include Del Rey wrapping herself in an American flag; another depicts her in sexual poses with an older man playing on a pinball machine.[19][25][26][27][28] The staff writers for Idolator commented on Del Rey's relationships as depicted in the video:She appears to take shelter in a series of different men: a scruffy biker who bends her over a pinball machine, a clean-cut older man who embraces her on a balcony, a different biker who slow-dances with her in what appears to be her dressing room. (Near the end of the video, there is a succession of shots of Del Rey rolling around in the sand at different times with at least two of them — and she licks at least one on the ear). It ends where it began, with Del Rey alone on the tire swing.[23]At the end of the clip, Del Rey declares, "I am fucking crazy. But I am free."[29] Released online on October 12, the video mirrored the one shown at the Santa Monica premiere and featured a self-authored treatment reminiscent of her work on "National Anthem."[19][20]NME journalist Lucy Jones compared Del Rey's role in "Ride" to Blanche DuBois' role in A Streetcar Named Desire, calling it a "neurasthenic wreckage." Further reflecting on the Lolita persona, Jones says, "Del Rey's character atrophies into prostitution, seeking safety in other people" throughout the video, which she labels dis-empowering for women, while Del Rey's "suggested acceptance of a young woman selling sex for a roof over her head" might be seen as antifeminist,[20] a word attributed to Del Rey's work since "Video Games."[30][31]OK! and Vibe also noted the prostitution themes,[26] the latter saying, "Never has the art of prostitution ever looked so, cinematic."[32]Jones also noted similarities between "Ride" and the video for "Born to Die", specifically Del Rey's scarlet talons, red Converse, inverted crucifix earrings, Stars and Stripes flags, tattoos, and guns.[20] Jones speculated that the monologue was not autobiographical, so much as a jab at her critics.[20]Pitchfork considered the metaphor-festooned monologue "moving."[21] Writers for the New York Observer commented: "As a statement of purpose, it’s absolutely, refreshingly meaningless, not purporting to make any statement beyond provocation; as a creation myth for whoever Lana Del Rey is, it’s tremendously watchable. She strives for little more than that."[33] Amanda Dobbins of New York concluded that the final scene belonged in Del Rey's hall of fame, stating, "it is really something."[34]MTV Buzzworthy's David Greenwald contrasted "Ride" with films such as Easy Rider, mentioning that while it contained traditional American themes, it manages to retain credibility as a pop song on par with Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga.[35]
