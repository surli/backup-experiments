Theodore Allen, or known simply as The Allen, (fl. 1880â€“1890) was an American gambler, political organizer, saloon keeper and head of a criminal family in New York City during the mid-to late 19th century.[2] Born to a devout and prominent Methodist family, he and four of his brothers were notorious underworld figures; Wesley, Martin and William Allen were professional burglars while the fourth brother, John Allen, ran an illegal gambling den.[3]He was the owner of The American Mabille, named after the Jardin de Mabille in Paris, originally located at a Bleecker Street home. The popular resort included a dance hall and concert saloon, in the basement and first floor respectively, which housed "all classes of the demi-monde from the sun-bleared Cyprian of the Bowery ... to the diamond-bedecked mistress of some sporting man" [4] and where it was said "dissolute women in gaudy tights danced and sang ribald songs". It was also notorious for luring its female working class patrons into prostitution,[2] one journalist claiming that the concert saloon caused "the ruin of more young girls then all the dive keepers in New York".[4] Allen owned half a dozen similar establishments, among them the St. Bernard Hotel at Prince and Mercer Streets, as well as financed gambling dens, brothels and other "places of ill-fame". Closely associated with many criminals and gang chieftains of the period, as well as the principal competitor of Billy McGlory's Armory Hall,[4] he planned and participated in numerous bank and store robberies. He eventually fled the city after killing a gambler and disappeared.[3]
