His further topics of research include the foundation of quantum mechanics, space-time at Planck scale, the group approach in quantum cosmology, systems theory, non-linear dynamics, as well as computation in physical, biological and cognitive systems (logical openness, sub and super Turing systems).[4] Licata has developed a new approach to quantum cosmology ("Archaic Universe") based on de Sitter invariant special relativity.
