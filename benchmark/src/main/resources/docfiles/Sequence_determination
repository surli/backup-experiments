A sequence determination is a type of examination conducted by a forensic document examiner.[1] This type of forensic examination is done in an attempt to determine which of two events occurred first in the preparation of a document. Another term used for this type of examination is "sequence of intersections" since the evaluation requires intersection of physical materials on the document.The primary means of evaluation involves direct visual examination using microscopy and various lighting options. The intersection point may involve subtle deviations from the normal manner of deposition or production that can be observed on microscopic examination (e.g. extraneous ink deposits, skipping, misalignents, embossing, etc.). Lifting/casting technique (see below) have also been tested with some success. Intersections involving indentations may also be assessed using an electrostatic detection device to visualize latent indentations.The underlying concept is that each of the sequences will produce a distinctive result that can be visualized or measured.In some instances, the results will be essentially conclusive with only one reasonable interpretation. In other situations, the results may be less definite in that the observed features may permit more than one interpretation of the original sequence.
