Marsha Boulton (born c. 1952) is a Canadian journalist and humorist, who won the Stephen Leacock Award in 1996 for her book Letters from the Country.[1] Some early media reports incorrectly credited her as the first woman ever to win the award,[2] although in fact four women — Sondra Gotlieb, Joan Walker, Jan Hilliard and Angeline Hango — had won the award before her.Her other books have included More Letters from the Country (1997), Just a Minute: Glimpses of Our Great Canadian Heritage (1998), Just Another Minute (1998), Letters from Across the Country (1999) and Just a Minute More (1999), as well as republished "omnibus" editions of both the Letters from the Country and Just a Minute series.Originally from Toronto, Ontario, where she was a journalist and editor for Maclean's,[3] she moved in 1980 to a farm in Wellington County with her husband Stephen Williams, a journalist best known for his works on Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka.[4] After her move, she wrote a syndicated column about country life which appeared in 40 newspapers across Canada,[3] was a contributor to CBC Radio,[3] and contributed to publications including Canadian Business, Chatelaine, the Toronto Star and Toronto Life.
