datamill is a Java framework for web applications using a functional reactive style built on RxJava. It is intended to
be used with Java 8 and lambdas. Unlike other modern Java frameworks, it makes the flow and manipulation of data through
your application highly visible. That means that you won't find yourself strewing your code with magic annotations,
whose function and effect are hidden within complex framework code and documentation. Instead, you will explicitly
specify how data flows through your application, and how to modify that data as it does. And you do so using the simple
style that RxJava allows.

datamill is still in an early stage of development but we use it to build several large web applications we're working on. While we find it a joy to work with, we expect some issues may crop up, and some things will change.
