Welcome to Dari!
================

Dari is a powerful data modeling framework that makes it easy to work with
complex data structures and persist them to one or more database backends. It's
been carefully crafted over years of experience with real-world challenges.

To start using it, take a look at the [documentation](http://www.dariframework.org/documentation.html).

Why?
====

We believe that working with data, whether they’re simple blog posts or
something much more complex, is the most critical part of building any
application. It’s also the most difficult and frustrating, because the current
generation of data access frameworks don’t do enough to provide you with all
the information necessary to let you be productive as possible.

Dari was created at [PERFECT SENSE digital](http://www.perfectsensedigital.com/)
to make our work in handling data for a variety of clients in different
industries easier and more efficient. We wanted to create a comprehensive
toolset that spans every aspect of how data flows throughout your application.

This is the fruit of our work so far, and we wanted to share it with the world.
We hope you enjoy working with it as much as we do.
