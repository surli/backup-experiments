## Credits

EpubCheck is a project coordinated by [IDPF](http://idpf.org/). Most of the EpubCheck functionality comes from the schema validation tool [Jing](http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html) and schemas that were developed by [IDPF](http://www.idpf.org/) and [DAISY](http://www.daisy.org/). Initial EpubCheck development was largely done at [Adobe Systems](http://www.adobe.com/).
