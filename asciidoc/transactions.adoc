## Transactions

Rapidoid also provides JPA transaction management, which is activated when a route is marked as transactional using `.transaction(...)` or `@Transactional` handler method.

The transaction boundaries match the execution scope of the request handler, so every request is handled in a separate transaction.

For custom transaction scope and complete (programmatic) control over a transaction, you can call:

```
JPA.transaction(...)
```
