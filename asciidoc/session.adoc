### Session management

A _HTTP session_ is a temporary data storage that spans multiple HTTP requests.
Data is stored in the session to be accessed later, when handling another HTTP request from the same user (and browsing session).

There are 2 different implementations of the session:

 - server-side session a.k.a. _session_
 - client-side token as a session a.k.a. _token_

#### Server-side session a.k.a. _session_

The server-side session is a simple in-memory storage in the web server.

##### Non-trivial scaling out with server-side session

While there's no problem when running an application on only one web server, scaling out is non-trivial.
It requires sticky sessions or replicating the session, or storing it into some datastore.

#### Client-side token as a session a.k.a. _token_

The *token is small, important data* that is not stored on the server.

##### Super-easy scaling out with token as a session

The main purpose of the token is keeping the servers stateless (a.k.a. shared-nothing architecture).
This approach allows easy scaling out of the application on multiple servers.

##### Inside the token

The token has a Map-like structure, and it can store arbitrary data. By default, it stores:

- username of the logged-in user
- token expiration time
- scope of validity of the token

##### Persisting the token

The token is being serialized and sent to the web browser as a cookie.
For the web browser this is just a cookie, so it sends the cookie to the server attached to the subsequent HTTP requests.

##### Token limitations

The main drawback of the token is the browser's cookie size limits.
Each browser has different limit for the size of the cookies, but the safest limit to assume is `4 KB`.
That's why the token should be used to store only small data.

##### Token security

The token is encrypted and HMAC-signed with the application's secret key.
Thus, the user canâ€™t read nor modify the token data in a malicious way (or any way).

##### Token expiration

After a configurable time (config `token.ttl` in milliseconds), the token expires.

The token cookie will also expire when the browser is closed.

#### Configuring the token

Please see the `token` configuration section.
