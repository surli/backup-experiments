### JPA

Rapidoid provides generic JPA support. For a quick start it also includes Hibernate in the `rapidoid-quick` module.

#### API

Please take a look at the `JPA` class.

#### Bootstrap

Rapidoid can bootstrap Hibernate 4 (Hibernate 5 will eventually be supported):

```java
App.bootstrap(args).jpa();
```

This will scan the application package on the classpath, find the annotated JPA entities and register them with Hibernate.
