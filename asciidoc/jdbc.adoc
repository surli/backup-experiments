### JDBC

#### API

Please take a look at the `JDBC` and `JdbcClient` classes.

#### Connection pools

Rapidoid provides out-of-the-box support the `C3P0` and `Hikari` connection pools.

NOTE: The `Hikari` support is considered early-access, but it performs well.

#### Providing custom DataSource

Please take a look at `JdbcClient#dataSource`.

#### Paging

Support for automatic paging through the results of JDBC queries will be available soon.
