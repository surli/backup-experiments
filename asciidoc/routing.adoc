### Request routing

A web application can be defined as a collection of HTTP
request handlers. The HTTP requests are routed to the appropriate
lambda, based on the combination of:

 - the *request verb* (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `TRACE`)
 - and the *request path* (e.g. `/books/123`, `/users`).

#### Matching route
Rapidoid tries to find a matching handler for the route of the pending request.
If no handler matches the route, the first generic handler (if any) will be executed.

#### Generic handlers
The generic handlers are ordered in the order they were registered.
The generic handlers match any route, and they can be registered with `On.req()`.
If a generic handler returns `not found`, the next generic handler will be executed.

#### Not found
If no handler manages to process the request, a `not found` HTTP response is returned.
