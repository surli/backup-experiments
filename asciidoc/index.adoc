This is the new documentation for http://www.rapidoid.org[Rapidoid] (v5.4).

For older versions of Rapidoid, please see http://www.rapidoid.org/docs-5.3.html[v5.3] and http://www.rapidoid.org/documentation.html[the old docs].

Things to improve in the docs:

- the important concepts (architecture, design etc.) should be explained in more details,
- the examples should be organized by categories,
- information about the HTTP routes and sample requests/responses should be included for each example.

## What is Rapidoid?

Rapidoid is an extremely fast HTTP server and modern Java web framework / application container, with a strong focus on high productivity and high performance.
