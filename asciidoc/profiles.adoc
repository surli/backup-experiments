## Profiles

Application profiles are useful to conditionally activate application beans or configuration.

### The default profile

If no profiles are specified, the `default` profile will automatically be activated.

### Conditionally activated profiles

Depending on the configured or inferred environment mode (dev / test / production), one of the `dev`, `test` or `production` profiles will also be automatically activated (in addition to the default or configured profiles).

### Configuring active profiles

There are several ways to activate the application profiles:

- command line argument:

`profiles=foo,bar`

- environment variable:

`PROFILES=foo,bar`

- programmatically:
```
App.profiles("foo", "bar");
```

TIP: Activating a `prod` or `production` profile automatically marks the environment mode as `production`.

### Built-in profile-specific configuration

Rapidoid has built-in default configuration for the profiles `default`, `dev` and `mysql`.
