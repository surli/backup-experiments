## Performance

The network communication of Rapidoid is fully asynchronous (e.g. epoll on Linux).
Several benchmarks have demonstrated stable high performance with 16K connections.

The number of _I/O threads_ in Rapidoid equals the number of cores.
E.g. on a 8-core machine there would be 8 I/O threads.

The number of _job executor threads_ can vary (e.g. 32, 128, 512, 1024 or more).


### Managed vs unmanaged request handlers

The request processing can be done in a _managed_ and _unmanaged_ way:

 - *managed* (the default): each request will be handled inside a job executed on the executor service (using `Jobs.*`).
 This is the most convenient and powerful option, as it includes some built-in functionality:

    ** request wrappers/interceptors
    ** access control
    ** transaction management

 - *unmanaged* - configured by `route.managed(false)`: every request is handled on the I/O thread that received it.
  This is the fastest option and most flexible option, as it gives the developer complete control over the request handling.

NOTE: The handlers that are executed in _unmanaged_ way should execute quickly and in non-blocking way.


### Asynchronous handlers

For asynchronous handlers, which continue to execute some logic outside the handler job, `Req#async()` and `Req#done()` should be used.
