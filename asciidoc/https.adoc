## HTTPS & TLS

It's easy to enable serving over `HTTPS` (or TLS for any protocol, in general) with Rapidoid.
The server will listen on the same port, but instead of `HTTP` it will serve `HTTPS`.

### Self-signed certificates

If configured, Rapidoid will create (untrusted) self-signed certificates, which might be useful for quick demo/testing purposes.
