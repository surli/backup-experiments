### Rapidoid's template engine

Starting from v5.1, Rapidoid has its own template engine. Basically, it is very similar to Mustache, with the following differences:

  - Using `${x}` instead of `{{x}}`. This syntax is very common in the Java world, and it also avoids collision of the `{{x}}` tags with the front-end libraries (e.g. Angular).
  - Supporting additional `{{?x}}...{{/}}` tag for `if`. The traditional `{{#x}}...{{/x}}` remains unchanged, having both `foreach` and `if` semantics.
  - Providing text alternative if the value if not available e.g. `${x|something else}`
