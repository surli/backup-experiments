### Reverse proxy and load balancer

Starting from v5.2, Rapidoid can be also used as a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer.
A basic round-robin load balancer is included and configured as a default one.

The reverse proxy can be configured programatically (optionally with custom load balancers).

The reverse proxy can also be configured from the command-line args.
The command-line argument syntax is: `/path -> upstream1,upstream2...`. Examples:

  - `/ -> https://localhost:8080`
  - `/foo -> https://upstream1:8080, http://upstream2:8080`

#### Configuring

Please see the `reverse-proxy` configuration section.
