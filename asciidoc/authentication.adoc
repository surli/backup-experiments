## Authentication

### Bootstrapping the authentication services

Rapidoid provides built-in authentication services:

  - `POST /_login`
  - `GET /_logout`

You can easily bootstrap these services:

```
App.bootstrap(args).auth()
```

WARNING: The built-in `GET /_logout` handler will be changed to `POST /_logout` in future.

### Authentication flow

- A `POST /_login` request containing `username` and `password` will execute the (custom-configured or default) login handler.
- If the login handler returns `true`, the user was authenticated and the *authentication data* (`username` and `login expiration time`) are saved in the *token*.
- The token is returned by the `POST /_login` handler, but it is also persisted in the `_token` cookie.
- With every request the authentication data is being sent through the token, so the server can identify the user.
- When the browser is closed, the `_token` cookie expires, so the `auth data` is lost.
- The `token` can be sent with a HTTP request as a `_token` cookie, or a `_token` parameter (in the URI or the body).
- After a configurable time (config `token.ttl` in milliseconds), the authentication of the logged-in user expires.
- A `GET /_logout` request will execute the built-in logout handler which clears the authentication data from the token.

### The Admin API

The `Admin.*` API is a mirror of the `On` API, but for the Admin setup.
The `administrator` role is configured by default for all routes of this API.
