### Serving static files

It's very easy to serve static files with Rapidoid.
Just add them as resources inside the `static` folder on the classpath in your Java project.

TIP: Most of the Java projects use Maven, so the static files should usually be placed in `src/main/resources/static`.

#### Built-in static resources

Rapidoid includes some built-in static resources in a `default/static` folder on the classpath.

Thus, both `default/static` and `static` are default locations for serving static files.

The `static` location has precedense over the `default/static` location.

#### Automatically serving the static resources

Once a HTTP server is started, it will serve all the resources that exist in the `static` and `default/static` locations on the classpath.
They will be publicly available.
