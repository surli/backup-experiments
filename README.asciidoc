== Versioning

The project has adopted the http://semver.org[Semantic Versioning] spec from v2.2.0 onwards to maintain an 
understandable backwards compatibility strategy.

The version format is as follows:

----
<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<label>
----

* An increment of the major version represents incompatible API changes.
* An increment of the minor version represents additional functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
* An increment of the patch version represents backwards-compatible bug fixes.
* Existence of a label represents a pre-release or build metadata.

== Build System

The project uses Apache Maven as the build system. To build the JBake distribution ZIP file execute the following command from the root of the repo:

----
$ mvn package
----

This will build a ZIP file in the `/dist` folder.

Alternatively you can run directly from the source code using the Maven exec plugin:

----
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=org.jbake.launcher.Main -Dexec.args="/fromFolder /tmp/toFolder/"
----
